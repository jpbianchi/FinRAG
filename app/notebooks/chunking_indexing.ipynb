's (A1/Prime-1 stable) credit profile reflects its powerful global brand, which\\nis synonymous with online retail, as well as the strength and profitability of Amazon Web\\nServices (“AWS”), the market leader in the cloud computing market. The company is reliant\\non the operating income derived from AWS, as its non-AWS profitability has remained weak\\nsince the end of 2021. Although the company is making progress with improving productivity\\nand reducing costs, online operating margins remain well below historical levels. Amazon has\\ntaken actions to make its fulfillment operations more efficient as its business grows into its\\ncapacity, which doubled during the pandemic. Amazon has also built a solid ecosystem of\\nentertainment content that enhances its offering, operates a formidable third-party seller\\nbusiness and generates a solid and growing revenue stream from advertising. Nonetheless,\\nits credit metrics are currently weak for the A1 rating with RCF/Debt below 50%, as lower\\nprofitability, coupled with increased levels of investment have led to higher debt levels\\nand lower cash balances. Capital allocation will be critical to improving its credit profile as\\nAmazon navigates a weaker economic backdrop that could dampen demand for its products\\nand services as it pursues cost reductions and efficiencies to restore profitability at online\\nretail. The growing online presence of brick-and-mortar retailers, as well as the increasing\\ncompetition from larger, well capitalized companies in AWS' universe also presents future\\nchallenges.\\nExhibit 1\\nAmazon's debt has continued to rise as operating income remains below 2019\\n$0$20,000$40,000$60,000$80,000$100,000$120,000$140,000$160,000$180,000\\n$0$5,000$10,000$15,000$20,000$25,000$30,000\\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Q1 -23 LTM\\nMoody's Adjusted Debt (USD Millions)Moody's Adj.

Despite still being relatively early in the conversion of companies transitioning to the cloud, revenue\\ngrowth and profitability of AWS continues to experience a slowing of growth in Q1 2023 as companies try to find more effective\\ncost solutions. Revenue growth in Q1 2023 has decelerated to 15.8% from 20.2% in Q4 2022 and 27.5% in Q3 2022, as operating\\nmargins decline sequentially and from last year. These trends have continued into Q2 2023 with April revenue growth rates lower than\\nQ1 2023. We expect revenue growth to improve toward the end of 2023 as optimization efforts of customers are exhausted. AWS’\\ncustomers continue to increase commitments for future capacity usage and we expect strong long-term growth for AWS benefiting\\nfrom migration of IT infrastructure investments from on-premise to the cloud. AWS is also well-positioned to capitalize on the rapidly\\ngrowing AI opportunity in the cloud with its scalable infrastructure, tools for developers to build and deploy models and services that\\ncustomers can use to leverage proprietary large language models. At the same time, AWS faces strong competitors with financial\\nresources such as Microsoft Corporation (Aaa Stable), Oracle Corporation (Baa2 Stable), Alphabet Inc. (Aa2 Stable), and IBM (A3\\nStable) that all aim to grow market share. Operating margin expansion for AWS could be challenged by increasing competition and\\nelevated investments.\\n3          23 May 2023 Amazon.com, Inc.: Update to credit analysis\",\n",
       "  \"MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE CORPORATES\\nOnline retail presence still dominates as digital efforts of brick and mortar accelerate\\nAmazon's online retail is the clear leader relative its US competitors. Nonetheless, competition has accelerated from larger players such\\nas Walmart Inc. (Aa2 stable), Target Corporation (A2 stable) and Best Buy Co., Inc. (A3 stable), all of which have continued to enhance\\ntheir online capabilities. These larger brick-and-mortar retailers can also leverage their store networks and proprietary distribution\\ncapability to offer the consumer options for obtaining their purchases. In store pickup provides a competitive offering (within hours\\nin most cases) and a more cost effective alternative to the seller. In addition, some brick-and-mortar retailers already have vehicle\\nnetworks that are used to stock its stores which could be used for some same day delivery capability. An example is the auto parts\\nretailers, which measure delivery times in hours, not days.\\nAmazon faces an increasingly competitive environment as the pandemic accelerated investment in areas such as curbside pickup,\\ninventory visibility and better usage of stores to fulfill orders. To combat these growing competitive threats, Amazon continues to\\nsupport its Prime Free One-Day Delivery initiative, which is an effort to counter buy-online/pick-up in store. The company is also\\nmoving its fulfillment network to a regionalized model which is expected to improve delivery speed and cost. To offset rising costs, the\\ncompany increased pricing on its prime membership in the U.S. in 2022 from $119 to $139 annually. The move, which is the first price\\nincrease since 2018 and will provide to offset to these continued investments.\\nThird-party sales remains an important part of the business with growth continuing to outpace first-party. Third party comprises\\n59% of paid units relative to 55% for the same period last year. The company has implemented a fuel and inflation as well as a peak\\nfulfillment surcharge on fulfillment fee per unit rates for Fulfilled by Amazon sellers in the face of rising inflation and energy costs. We\\nnote that Walmart has increased its third party efforts with its Advance Auto Parts and Shopify relationships. In the Advance example,\\nWalmart is providing space in its stores, as well as the use of its distribution network and placement on the website.\\nPhysical store sales remain primarily from Whole Foods. The 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods consisting now of over 500 locations\\nprovides Amazon with a “scalable” food business, as well as pickup points for online orders across categories. The company has closed\\nsome non-core concepts including its physical bookstores, and 4-star stores.\\nAdvertising revenue continues to grow rapidly in programmatic advertising and, in our opinion, has an advantage in this area given\\nits significant e-commerce presence and data gatheri ng. Growth in advertising revenue remains robust at over 23% in Q1 2023.\\nAdvertising for LTM March 2023 was roughly $39.4 billion, and we note advertising operating margins are generally healthy and\\ntypically run in the midteens. Along with AWS, the profitability of this category provides “buffer” to support its retail operations\\nperforming well below historical operating margins.\\nCost pressures are being addressed as investment is targeted at or below 2022 levels\\nAmazon's retail operations is contending with the inefficiency posed by the more than doubling of its capacity during the pandemic,\\nAmazon continues to work to move its cost structure closer to pre-pandemic levels and has made significant head count reduction\\nwith 27,000 roles eliminated including areas such as AWS as well as Twitch, devices, advertising and human resources.\\nAmazon remains committed to providing value to customers, despite inflation while slowing remaining elevated. The company is\\nbenefiting from continued improvement in shipping speeds and in-stock rates have recovered. Amazon has been contending with\\nhigher costs related to system productivity and inflation since the second half of 2021.\\nDuring first quarter 2023, Amazon continued to take cost cutting measures to improve margins and make progress on reducing its\\ncash usage. These efforts include shutting down businesses such as Amazon Fabric and Amazon Care as well as closing eight Amazon\\nGo locations. The company has also increased its minimum grocery purchases from $35 to $150 for free shipping and reduced\\ncorporate head count. Nonetheless, cost structure improvements have been partially offset by increased spend in advertising and other\\ninvestments such as video content and marketing costs.\\nAmazon expects investment in 2023 to be at or below 2022 levels at it reduces its spending on fulfillment and transportation given\\nits significant increase in capacity in recent years and shifts spending to technology and related infrastructure including large language\\nmodels and generative AI. In 2022, the company spent approximately $59 billion in capital investments.\\nAmazon has continued to pursue acquisitions it has exited businesses that are not reaching long term return goals. The company\\nacquired MGM Holdings Inc. (“MGM”) for approximately $8.5 billion, including MGM’s debt, in Q1 2022 which increased its video\\n4          23 May 2023 Amazon.com, Inc.: Update to credit analysis\",\n",

MGM's revenue of\\nabout $1.5 billion represents less than 1% of Amazon's revenue. The company also closed in Q1 2023 on its $4 billion purchase of\\n1Life Healthcare Inc. “One Medical,” a national primary care provider with approximately $1 billion of LTM revenue as of December\\n2022. One Medical operates a chain of primary healthcare clinics. The business is based on a membership model where the company\\ncharges a fixed monthly subscription fee and in exchange provides regular primary care services. The company focuses on both physical\\nappointments and digital offerings. The company also has announced its intention to acquire iRobot for approximately $1.9 billion. The\\npurchase is currently still being reviewed by the FTC.\\nWe estimate that Amazon's RCF/debt can return to near our target of 50% RCF/debt at the end of 2023 to the extent that Amazon\\nprioritizes aligning free cash flow generation with its investments. Our estimates assumes that free cash flow is positive and utilized to\\nreduce funded debt. Nonetheless, the economic back drop remains weak which poses a need for continued capital allocation discipline\\nto achieve this goal. We also recognize that cash+short term investments as a percentage of debt remains below historical levels.\\nExhibit 5\\nRetained cash flow to debt expected to recover in the next 12-18 months\\n20%25%30%35%40%45%50%55%60%65%70%\\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Q1-23 LTM 12-18 Months\\nForward ViewUp Trigger Down Trigger RCF/Debt\\nCredit metrics reflect Moody's standard adjustments\\nSource: Moody’s Financial Metrics™, Moody's estimates\\nESG considerations\\nAmazon.com, Inc.'s ESG Credit Impact Score is Neutral-to-Low CIS-2\\nExhibit 6\\nESG Credit Impact Score\\nSource: Moody's Investors Service\\n(CIS-2 ) Amazon's ESG Credit Impact Score reflects our assessment that its governance practices which include maintaining high cash\\nbalances positions the company to meet its moderate exposure to environmental and social risks.\\n5          23 May 2023 Amazon.com, Inc.: Update to credit analysis\",\n",
       "  \"MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE CORPORATES\\nExhibit 7\\nESG Issuer Profile Scores\\nSource: Moody's Investors Service\\nEnvironmental\\n(E-3) Amazon's environmental risks reflect exposure to carbon transition risk as product transport, which currently relies primarily on\\ncombustion engine vehicles, remains integral to its operations. The company continues to invest in EV and is committed to growing\\nits EV fleet. Its physical climate risk is low as its operations are well diversified within the US and internationally. Natural capital risk is\\nviewed as low given its business diversification through AWS despite its sales of food and apparel.\\nSocial\\n(S-3) Amazon's social risk reflects its exposure to human capital, customer relations and responsible production. Human capital risk\\nhigher than most retailers, as AWS requires a more highly skilled workforce. The company’s exposure to risk related to demographic\\nand societal trends is lower than the that of the overall retail and apparel industry. Amazon remains poised to benefit from the\\ncontinued shift of consumers transacting online and the robust demand for IT infrastructure and the continued adoption of cloud\\nservices. Its business diversification with AWS and its significant volume with third party sellers lowers its responsible production risk.\\nData privacy issues surrounding both its online and web services segments increases customer relations risk.\\nGovernance\\n(G-2) Amazon's governance risk reflects its overall conservative financial policies, including the maintenance of high cash balances and\\nlimited shareholder distributions to date and its moderate leverage. The company has separate chairperson and CEO roles with Jeff\\nBezos as Chairman.\\nESG Issuer Profile Scores and Credit Impact Scores for the rated entity/transaction are available on Moodys.com. To view the latest\\nscores, please click here to go to the landing page for the entity/transaction on MDC and view the ESG Scores section.\\nLiquidity analysis\\nAmazon maintains strong liquidity from its significant cash balances, which provides the company with increased flexibility and this\\nremains a critical credit consideration. In January 2023, Amazon issued an $8 billion 364-day term loan to partially fund the One\\nMedical acquisition which closed February 2023. The company issued $12.75 billion of debt securities in April 2022 and $8.25 billion\\nin December 2022 ranging in maturity from 2024 to 2062. The use of proceeds were for general corporate purposes. We expect\\npositive free cash flow to be applied to debt reduction supported by improved working capital and better profitability at its non-AWS\\noperations.\\nIn March 2022, the company expanded its US commercial paper program to $20 billion. The commercial paper program includes the\\noption to issue €3 billion and is backed by a $10 billion revolving credit facility expiring March 29, 2025 as well as a $10 billion 364-day\\ncredit facility which was put in place on November 18, 2022 and may be extended once. As of March 31, 2023 the company had $7.8\\nbillion of commercial paper outstanding under its programs. A significant credit consideration to its short term and long term ratings\\nis Amazon's commitment to fully cover all commercial paper balances with the availability under its committed revolvers and excess\\nsame-day available cash balances. The commercial paper program is likely to be used to bridge working capital swings and adds to its\\nformidable liquidity profile. The revolving credit facility has same day availability, no ongoing MAC clause and no financial covenants.\\n6          23 May 2023 Amazon.com, Inc.: Update to credit analysis\",\n",

AT&Tis a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliatesoperate worldwide in the telecommunications andtechnology industries. You should read this discussion inconjunction with the consolidated financial statementsand accompanying notes (Notes). Unless otherwise noted,this discussion refers only to our continuing operationsand does not include discussion of balances or activity ofWarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd.

Upon the separation and distribution ofWarnerMedia, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria\\nfor discontinued operations. For discontinued operations,we also evaluated transactions that were components ofAT&T’s single plan of a strategic shift, includingdispositions that did not individually meet the criteria dueto materiality, and have determined discontinuedoperations to be comprised of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandrand Playdemic. These businesses are reflected in theaccompanying financial statements as discontinuedoperations, including for periods prior to theconsummation of the WarnerMedia/Discoverytransaction .(See Notes 6 and 23)\\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG\\nCapital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV\\nEntertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of\\nthe transaction, we separated our Video business,\\ncomprised of our U.S. video operations, and began\\naccounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the\\nequity method. (See Note 6)\\nWe have two reportable segments: Communications and\\nLatin America. Our segment results presented in Note 4and discussed below follow our internal managementreporting.

       "  'OVERVIEW\\nOperating revenues decreased in 2022 and 2021. The\\n2022 decline reflects the July 31, 2021 separation of the U.S.video business, other business divestitures that were notincluded in discontinued operations and lower BusinessWireline revenues driven by lower demand for legacyservices and product simplification. Partially offsettingdeclines were higher Mobility service and equipmentrevenues and, to a lesser extent, gains in broadbandservice in our Communications segment and growth inMexico wireless operations.\\nThe 2021 decline reflects the 2021 separation of the U.S.\\nvideo business and the October 2020 sale of wireless andwireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. VirginIslands. Also contributing to revenue declines was lowerBusiness Wireline revenues due in part to higher demandfor pandemic-related connectivity in the prior year.Partially offsetting declines were higher Mobilityequipment and service revenues and gains in broadbandservice, and growth in Mexico wireless operationsincluding favorable foreign exchange impacts.\\nOperations and support expenses decreased in 2022 and\\n2021. The 2022 decline reflects the separation of U.S. videoand lower personnel costs associated with ongoingtransformation initiatives, partially offset by higher baddebt expense, the elimination of Connect America FundPhase II (CAF II) government credits and increasedwholesale network access charges. Wireless equipmentcosts were up slightly, with higher sales volumes and thesale of higher-priced smartphones largely offset by lower3G shutdown costs in 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, weupdated the expected economic lives of customerrelationships, which extended the amortization period ofdeferred acquisition and fulfillment costs and reducedexpenses approximately $395, with $150 recorded toMobility, $115 to Business Wireline and $130 to ConsumerWireline.\\nThe 2021 decline reflects our 2021 business divestitures,\\nlower bad debt expense and lower personnel costsassociated with our transformation initiatives. Declineswere mostly offset by increased domestic wirelessequipment expense from higher volumes.\\nAsset impairments and abandonments and\\nrestructuring increased in 2022 and decreased in 2021.\\nThe increase in 2022 was primarily due to $24,812 ofnoncash goodwill impairments associated with ourBusiness Wireline, Consumer Wireline and Mexicoreporting units and were driven by higher interest ratesconsistent with the macroeconomic environment, withsecular declines also impacting Business Wireline growthrates (see Note 9). The increase in 2022 also included$1,413 of wireline conduit asset abandonments (see Note7) and $1,273 of restructuring and other impairmentcharges due to updated network build plans stemmingfrom spectrum acquired in recent auctions, severancecharges associated with transformation initiatives andimpairment of personal protective equipment inventory.Impairment charges in 2021 were lower than 2020,\\nreflecting a fourth-quarter 2020 impairment charge of$15,508 resulting from our assessment of therecoverability of the long-lived assets and goodwillassociated with our U.S. video business.\\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in\\n2022 and decreased in 2021.\\nDepreciation expense increased $218, or 1.2%, in 2022.\\nThe increase was primarily due to ongoing capitalinvestment for strategic initiatives such as fiber andnetwork upgrades and expansion, partially offset byhigher estimated lives of our fiber assets (see Note 7).Depreciation expense decreased $1,394, or 7.3%, in 2021,primarily due to ceasing depreciation on U.S. video held-for-sale assets.\\nAmortization expense decreased $49, or 22.5%, in 2022\\nand $3,277, or 93.8%, in 2021. Lower amortizationreflects our accelerated method of amortization ofintangible assets from previous acquisitions and ceasingamortization on U.S. video held-for-sale assets in 2021.\\nOperating income decreased in 2022 and increased in\\n2021. Our operating margin was (3.8)% in 2022, comparedto 19.3% in 2021 and 5.9% in 2020.\\nInterest expense decreased in 2022 primarily due to\\nlower debt balances and higher capitalized interestassociated with spectrum acquisitions, partially offset byhigher interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2021primarily due to lower interest rates and higher capitalizedinterest associated with spectrum acquisitions, partiallyoffset by higher debt balances.\\nEquity in net income of affiliates increased in 2022 and\\n2021, primarily due to the close of our transaction withTPG related to the U.S. video business, which resulted inour accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under theequity method of accounting beginning August 1, 2021(see Notes 6, 10 and 19).\\nOther income (expense) – net decreased in 2022\\nprimarily due to lower actuarial gains ($1,999 in 2022compared to $4,140 in 2021), lower pension andpostretirement benefit credits and lower returns on otherbenefit-related investments. Pension and postretirementbenefit credits decreased as a result of higher assumeddiscount rates and lower returns on benefit plan assets.Our 2022 benefit expense also includes approximately$280 favorable impact from a retirement benefit planchange, with $230 resulting from prior service credits(approximately $100 for Business Wireline, $80 forConsumer Wireline and $40 for Mobility) (see Note 14).\\nThe increase in 2021 was primarily due to the recognition\\nof $4,140 in actuarial gains, compared to losses of $4,169in 2020, and the recognition of $1,405 of debt redemptioncosts in 2020.

The 2022 decrease was primarily driven by lowerincome before income tax offset by impairments ofgoodwill (see Note 9), which are not deductible for taxpurposes.\\nThe increase in 2021 was primarily due to increased\\nincome before income taxes, offset primarily by theCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARESAct) benefit of U.S. federal Net Operating Loss (NOL)carryback and benefits of divestitures in 2021.\\nOur effective tax rate was (122.2)% in 2022, 18.5% in 2021,\\nand (329.9)% in 2020.

We alsoevaluate segment performance based on EBITDA and/orEBITDA margin, which is defined as operating incomeexcluding depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used\\nas part of our management reporting and we believeEBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to ourinvestors as it measures the cash generation potential ofour business units. EBITDA does not give effect todepreciation and amortization expenses incurred inoperating income nor is it burdened bycash used for debt\\nservice requirements and thus does not reflect availablefunds for distributions, reinvestment or otherdiscretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided bytotal revenues.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified into “Corporate”\\ncertain administrative costs borne by AT&T where thebusiness units do not influence decision making toconform with the current period presentation.

       "  'OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS OF THE\\nBUSINESS\\n2023 Revenue Trends We expect revenue growth in our\\nwireless and broadband businesses as customers demandinstant connectivity and higher speeds made possible bywireless network enhancements through 5G deploymentand our fiber network expansion. We believe that oursimplified go-to-market strategy for 5G inunderpenetrated markets will continue to contribute towireless subscriber and service revenue growth and thatexpansion of our fiber footprint and our multi-gigofferings will drive greater demand for broadbandservices on our fast-growing fiber network.\\nAs we expand our fiber reach, we will be orienting our\\nbusiness portfolio to leverage this opportunity to offsetcontinuing declines in legacy Business Wireline productsby growing connectivity with small to mid-sizedbusinesses. We plan to use our strong fiber and wirelessassets, broad distribution and converged product offersto strengthen our overall market position. We willcontinue to rationalize our product portfolio with alonger-term shift of the business to fiber and mobileconnectivity, and growth in value-added services .\\n2023 Expense Trends We expect the spending required to\\nsupport growth initiatives, primarily our continueddeployment of fiber and 5G to pressure expense trends in2023. To the extent customers further upgrade theirhandsets in 2023, the expenses associated with thosedevice sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.During 2023, we will also continue to prioritize efficiency,led by our cost transformation initiative. Theseinvestments will help prepare us to meet increasedcustomer demand for enhanced wireless and broadbandservices, including video streaming, augmented reality and“smart” technologies. The software benefits of our 5Gwireless technology should result in a more efficient useof capital and lower network-related expenses in thecoming years.\\nWe continue to transform our operations to be more\\nefficient and effective. We are restructuring businesses,sunsetting legacy networks, improving customer serviceand ordering functions through digital transformation,sizing our support costs and staffing with current activitylevels, and reassessing overall benefit costs. Cost savingsand asset sales align with our focus on debt reduction.Market Conditions The U.S. stock market experienced\\nvolatility and contraction in 2022. Several factors, includingthe continued impact from the global pandemic, haveresulted in changes in demand in business communicationservices. The global pandemic has caused, and could againcause, delays in the development, manufacturing(including the sourcing of key components) and shipmentof products, as well as continued tight labor market andactual or perceived inflation. Most of our products andservices are not directly affected by the imposition oftariffs on Chinese goods. However, we expect ongoingpressure on pricing during 2023 as we respond to thegeopolitical and macroeconomic environment and ourcompetitive marketplace, especially in wireless services.\\nIncluded on our consolidated balance sheets are assets\\nheld by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits.Our pension plans are subject to funding requirements ofthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, asamended (ERISA). We expect only minimal ERISAcontribution requirements to our pension plans for 2023.Investment returns on these assets depend largely ontrends in the economy, and a weakness in the equity, fixedincome and real asset markets could require us to makefuture contributions to the pension plans. In addition, ourpolicy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related toour pension and other postretirement plans in the periodin which they arise subjects us to earnings volatilitycaused by changes in market conditions; however, theseactuarial gains and losses do not impact segmentperformance as they are required to be recorded in “Otherincome (expense) – net.” Changes in our discount rate,which are tied to changes in the bond market, andchanges in the performance of equity markets, may havesignificant impacts on the valuation of our pension andother postretirement obligations at the end of 2023 (see“Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”).Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\\n\\t:',\n",

AT&Tsubsidiaries operating outside the United States aresubject to the jurisdiction of national and supranationalregulatory authorities in the markets where service isprovided.\\nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Telecom Act),\\nCongress established a national policy frameworkintended to bring the benefits of competition andinvestment in advanced telecommunications facilities andservices to all Americans by opening alltelecommunications markets to competition andreducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harmconsumer welfare. Nonetheless, over the ensuing twodecades, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)and some state regulatory commissions have maintainedor expanded certain regulatory requirements that wereimposed decades ago on our traditional wirelinesubsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies.More recently, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatoryagenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated andunnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes ina number of areas. We continue to support regulatory andlegislative measures and efforts, at both the state andfederal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdensthat inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offerneeded services to our customers, including initiatives totransition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensurethat legacy regulations are not further extended tobroadband or wireless services, which are subject tovigorous competition.\\nInternet The FCC currently classifies fixed and mobile\\nconsumer broadband services as information services,subject to light-touch regulation. However, some stateshave adopted legislation or issued executive orders thatwould reimpose net neutrality rules repealed by the FCC.Suits were filed concerning such laws in California andVermont. The California suit was dismissed withoutprejudice on May 4, 2022, and the California statute is nowin effect. The litigation challenging the Vermont statutehas been stayed pending the Second Circuit’s dispositionof an appeal by the State of New York of an orderenjoining enforcement of a New York statute regulatingbroadband rates on the ground that such statute ispreempted by federal law. We expect additional statesmay seek to impose net neutrality requirements in thefuture.\\nOn November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and\\nJobs Act (IIJA) was signed into law. The legislationappropriates $65,000 to support broadband deploymentand adoption. The National Telecommunications andInformation Agency (NTIA) is responsible for distributingmore than $48,000 of this funding, including $42,500 instate grants for broadband deployment projects inunserved and underserved areas. NTIA established initialrequirements for this program in May 2022 and isexpected to announce state grant allocations in 2023.The IIJA also appropriated $14,200 for establishment of\\nthe Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), an FCC-administered monthly, low-income broadband benefitprogram, replacing the Emergency Broadband Benefitprogram (established in December 2020 by theConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2021). Qualifyingcustomers can receive up to thirty dollars per month (orseventy-five dollars per month for those on Tribal lands)to assist with their internet bill. AT&T is a participatingprovider in the ACP program and will considerparticipating in the deployment program whereappropriate. The IIJA includes various provisions that haveresulted in FCC proceedings regarding ACP programadministration and consumer protection, reform of theexisting universal support program, and broadbandlabeling and equal access.\\nPrivacy-related legislation continues to be adopted or\\nconsidered in a number of jurisdictions. Legislative,regulatory and litigation actions could result in increasedcosts of compliance, further regulation or claims againstbroadband internet access service providers and others,and increased uncertainty in the value and availability ofdata.\\nWireless Industry-wide network densification and 5G\\ntechnology expansion efforts, which are needed to satisfyextensive demand for video and internet access, willinvolve significant deployment of “small cell” equipment.This increases the importance of local permittingprocesses that allow for the placement of small cellequipment in the public right-of-way on reasonabletimelines and terms. The FCC has adopted multiple Ordersstreamlining federal, state, and local wireless structurereview processes that had the tendency to delay andimpede deployment of small cell and relatedinfrastructure used to provide telecommunications andbroadband services. During 2020-2021, we have alsodeployed 5G nationwide on “low band” spectrum onmacro towers. Executing on the recent spectrumpurchase, we announced ongoing construction andcontinuing deployment of 5G on C-band spectrum in 2022and beyond.\\nEXPECTED GROWTH AREAS\\nOver the next few years, we expect our growth to come\\nfrom wireless and IP-based fiber broadband services. Weprovide integrated services to diverse groups ofcustomers in the U.S. on an integratedtelecommunications network utilizing differenttechnological platforms. In 2023, our key initiatives include:\\n• Continuing our wireless subscriber momentum and\\n5G deployment, with expansion of 5G service,\\nincluding to underpenetrated markets.\\n• Improving fiber penetration, accelerating subscriber\\ngrowth and increasing broadband revenues.\\n• Continuing to drive efficiencies and a competitive\\nadvantage through cost transformation initiatives\\nand product simplification.\\n\\t,',\n",
       "  'Wireless We expect to continue to deliver revenue\\ngrowth in the coming years. We are in a period of rapidgrowth in wireless video usage and believe that there aresubstantial opportunities available for next-generationconverged services that combine technologies andservices. As of December 31, 2022, we served 239 millionwireless subscribers in North America, with more than 217million in the United States.\\nOur LTE technology covers over 441 million people in\\nNorth America, and in the United States, we cover allmajor metropolitan areas and over 337 million people. Wealso provide 4G coverage using another technology(HSPA+), and when combined with our upgraded backhaulnetwork, we provide enhanced network capabilities andsuperior mobile broadband speeds for data and videoservices. In December 2018, we introduced the nation’sfirst commercial mobile 5G service and expanded thatdeployment nationwide in July 2020. At December 31,2022, our network covers more than 285 million peoplewith 5G technology in the United States and NorthAmerica.\\nOur networks covering both the U.S. and Mexico have\\nenabled our customers to use wireless services withoutroaming on other companies’ networks. We believe thisseamless access will prove attractive to customers andprovide a significant growth opportunity. At December 31,2022, we provided LTE coverage to over 104 million peoplein Mexico.\\nIntegration of Data and Broadband Services As the\\ncommunications industry has evolved into internet-basedtechnologies capable of blending wireline and wirelessservices, we plan to focus on expanding our wirelessnetwork capabilities and provide broadband offerings thatallow customers to integrate their home or business fixedservices with their mobile service. In January 2022, welaunched our multi-gig rollout, which brings the fastestinternet to AT&T Fiber customers with symmetrical 2 gigand 5 gig tiers. We will continue to develop and provideunique integrated mobile and broadband/fiber solutions.\\nREGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\\nSet forth below is a summary of the most significant\\nregulatory proceedings that directly affected ouroperations during 2022. Industry-wide regulatorydevelopments are discussed above in OperatingEnvironment Overview. While these issues may apply onlyto certain subsidiaries, the words “we,” “AT&T” and “our”are used to simplify the discussion. The followingdiscussions are intended as a condensed summary of theissues rather than as a comprehensive legal analysis anddescription of all of these specific issues.\\nInternational Regulation Our subsidiaries operating\\noutside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction ofregulatory authorities in the territories in which thesubsidiaries operate. Our licensing, compliance andadvocacy initiatives in foreign countries primarily enablethe provision of enterprise (i.e., large business) servicesglobally and wireless services in Mexico.The General Data Protection Regulation went into effect\\nin Europe in May of 2018. AT&T processes and handlespersonal data of its customers and subscribers,employees of its enterprise customers and its employees.This regulation created a range of new complianceobligations and significantly increased financial penaltiesfor noncompliance.\\nFederal Regulation We have organized our following\\ndiscussion by service impacted.\\nInternet The FCC currently classifies fixed and mobile\\nconsumer broadband services as information services,subject to light-touch regulation. The D.C. Circuit upheldthe FCC’s current classification, although it remandedthree discrete issues to the FCC for further consideration.These issues related to the effect of the FCC’s decision toclassify broadband services as information services onpublic safety, the regulation of pole attachments, anduniversal service support for low-income consumersthrough the Lifeline program. Because no party soughtSupreme Court review of the D.C. Circuit’s decision touphold the FCC’s classification of broadband as aninformation service, that decision is final.\\nIn October 2020, the FCC adopted an order addressing the\\nthree issues remanded by the D.C. Circuit for furtherconsideration. After considering those issues, the FCCconcluded there were no grounds to depart from itsdetermination that fixed and mobile consumer broadbandservices should be classified as information services. Anappeal of the FCC’s remand decision is pending.\\nSome states have adopted legislation or issued executive\\norders that would reimpose net neutrality rules repealedby the FCC. Suits were filed concerning such laws inCalifornia and Vermont. The California suit was dismissedwithout prejudice on May 4, 2022, and the Californiastatute is now in effect.

The IIJA includes various provisionsthat have resulted in FCC proceedings regarding ACPprogram administration and consumer protection, reformof the existing universal support program, and broadbandlabeling and equal access.\\nPrivacy-related legislation continues to be adopted or\\nconsidered in a number of jurisdictions. Legislative,regulatory and litigation actions could result in increasedcosts of compliance, further regulation or claims againstbroadband internet access service providers and others,and increased uncertainty in the value and availability ofdata.\\nWireless and Broadband In June and November 2020, the\\nFCC issued a Declaratory Ruling clarifying the limits onstate and local authority to deny applications to modifyexisting structures to accommodate wireless facilities.Appeals of the November 2020 order remain pending inthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, following multiplerequests by the FCC to hold the appeal in abeyance untilthe Senate confirms a fifth FCC Commissioner. Ifsustained on appeal, these FCC decisions will removestate and local regulatory barriers and reduce the costs ofthe infrastructure needed for 5G and FirstNetdeployments, which will enhance our ability to place smallcell facilities on utility poles, expand existing facilities toaccommodate public safety services, and replace legacyfacilities and services with advanced broadbandinfrastructure and services. During 2022, we have alsodeployed 5G nationwide on “low band” spectrum onmacro towers. Executing on the recent spectrumpurchase, we continued deploying 5G nationwide on “lowband” spectrum.\\nIn March 2020, the FCC released its order setting rules for\\ncertain spectrum bands (C-band) for 5G operations. Inthat order, the FCC concluded that C-band 5G servicesthat met the agency’s technical limits on power andemissions would not cause harmful interference withaircraft operations. In reliance on that order, AT&T bid atotal of $23,406 and was awarded 1,621 C-band licenses,including 40 MHz available for deployment in December2021, with the remainder available for deployment no laterthan December 2023. In late 2021, the Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) questioned whether the C-bandlaunch could impact radio altimeter equipment onairplanes, which operate on spectrum bands over 400 MHzaway from the spectrum AT&T launched in 2022 and 220MHz away from spectrum AT&T plans to launch in 2023. Inresponse, to allow the FAA more time to evaluate, AT&Tand Verizon delayed their planned December 2021 5G C-band launch by six weeks and voluntarily committed to aseries of temporary, precautionary measures, in additionto deferring turning on a limited number of towers aroundcertain airports. These measures have been subsequentlymodified from time to time. We continue to work with the\\nFAA to reduce the temporary measures with C-banddeployments as aircraft equipment is upgraded.\\nIn recent years, the FCC took several actions to make\\nspectrum available for 5G services, including the auctionof 280 MHz of mid-band spectrum previously used forsatellite service (the “C Band” auction) and 39 GHz bandspectrum. AT&T obtained spectrum in these auctions (see“Other Business Matters”). The FCC also made 150 MHz ofmid-band CBRS spectrum available, to be shared withFederal incumbents, which enjoy priority. In addition, theFCC recently completed Auction 110, in which AT&T won40 MHz of 3.45 GHz spectrum nationwide at a cost of$9,079.\\nCOMPETITION\\nCompetition continues to increase for communications\\nand digital services from traditional and nontraditionalcompetitors. Technological advances have expanded thetypes and uses of services and products available. Inaddition, lack of or a reduced level of regulation ofcomparable legacy services has lowered costs foralternative communications service providers. As a result,we face continuing competition as well as some newopportunities in significant portions of our business.\\nWireless We face substantial competition in our wireless\\nbusinesses. Under current FCC rules, multiple licensees,who provide wireless services on the cellular, PCS,Advanced Wireless Services, 700 MHz and other spectrumbands, may operate in each of our U.S. service areas. Ourcompetitors include two national wireless providers; alarger number of regional providers and resellers of thoseservices; and certain cable companies. In addition, we facecompetition from providers who offer voice, textmessaging and other services as applications on datanetworks. We are one of three facilities-based providers inMexico (retail and wholesale), with the most significantmarket share controlled by América Móvil. We mayexperience significant competition from companies thatprovide similar services using other communicationstechnologies and services. While some of thesetechnologies and services are now operational, others arebeing developed or may be developed. We compete forcustomers based principally on service/device offerings,price, network quality, coverage area and customerservice.\\nBroadband The desire for high-speed data on demand,\\nincluding video, is continuing to lead customers toterminate their traditional wired or linear services and useour fiber services or competitors’ wireless, satellite andinternet-based services. In most U.S. markets, we competefor customers with large cable companies for high-speedinternet and voice services, wireless broadband providers,and other smaller telecommunications companies forboth long-distance and local services.\\n\\t?',\n",
       "  'Legacy Voice and Data We continue to lose legacy voice\\nand data subscribers due to competitors (e.g., wireless,cable and VoIP providers) who can provide comparableservices at lower prices because they are not subject totraditional telephone industry regulation (or the extent ofregulation they are subject to is in dispute), utilizedifferent technologies or promote a different businessmodel (such as advertising-based).\\nAdditionally, we provide local and interstate telephone\\nand switched services to other service providers, primarilylarge internet service providers using the largest class ofnationwide internet networks (internet backbone),wireless carriers, other telephone companies, cablecompanies and systems integrators. These services aresubject to additional competitive pressures from thedevelopment of new technologies, the introduction ofinnovative offerings and increasing satellite, wireless,fiber-optic and cable transmission capacity for services.\\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates Because of\\nthe size of the financial statement line items they relate toor the extent of judgment required by our management,some of our accounting policies and estimates have amore significant impact on our consolidated financialstatements than others.\\nPension and Postretirement Benefits Our actuarial\\nestimates of retiree benefit expense and the associatedsignificant weighted-average assumptions are discussedin Note 14. Our assumed weighted-average discount ratesfor both pension and postretirement benefits of 5.20%, atDecember 31, 2022, reflect the hypothetical rate at whichthe projected benefit obligations could be effectivelysettled or paid out to participants. We determined ourdiscount rate based on a range of factors, including a yieldcurve composed of the rates of return on several hundredhigh-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available atthe measurement date and corresponding to the relatedexpected durations of future cash outflows for theobligations. These bonds had an average rating of at leastAa3 or AA- by the nationally recognized statistical ratingorganizations, denominated in U.S. dollars, and generallynot callable, convertible or index linked. For the yearended December 31, 2022, when compared to the yearended December 31, 2021, we increased our pensiondiscount rate by 2.20%, resulting in a decrease in ourpension plan benefit obligation of $11,738, and increasedour postretirement discount rate by 2.40%, resulting in adecrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of$2,102.\\nOur expected long-term rate of return was 6.75% on\\npension plan assets and 4.50% on postretirement planassets for 2022. We have increased our expected return onplan assets to 7.50% on pension plan assets and 6.50% onpostretirement plan assets for 2023, reflecting higherlong-term capital market expectations for equities andhigher yields for bonds. Our expected return on planassets is calculated using the actual fair value of planassets. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we\\nexpect that a 0.50% decrease in the expected long-termrate of return would cause 2023 combined pension andpostretirement cost to increase $201, which under ouraccounting policy would be adjusted to actual returns inthe current year upon remeasurement of our retireebenefit plans.\\nWe recognize gains and losses on pension and\\npostretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in“Other income (expense) – net” in our consolidatedstatements of income. These gains and losses aregenerally measured annually as of December 31, andaccordingly, will normally be recorded during the fourthquarter, unless an earlier remeasurement is required.Should actual experience differ from actuarialassumptions, the projected pension benefit obligation andnet pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefitobligation and postretirement benefit cost would beaffected in future years. See Note 14 for additionaldiscussions regarding our assumptions.\\nDepreciation Our depreciation of assets, including use of\\ncomposite group depreciation for certain subsidiaries andestimates of useful lives, is described in Notes 1 and 7.\\nIf all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect\\nthat a one-year increase in the useful lives of our plant inservice would have resulted in a decrease ofapproximately $2,653 in our 2022 depreciation expenseand that a one-year decrease would have resulted in anincrease of approximately $3,778 in our 2022 depreciationexpense. See Notes 7 and 8 for depreciation andamortization expense applicable to property, plant andequipment, including our finance lease right-of-use assets.\\nAsset Valuations and ImpairmentsGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are\\nnot amortized but tested at least annually on October 1for impairment. For impairment testing, we estimate fairvalues using models that predominantly rely on theexpected cash flows to be derived from the reporting unitor use of the asset. Long-lived assets are reviewed forimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicatethat the book value may not be recoverable over theremaining life. Inputs underlying the expected cash flowsinclude, but are not limited to, subscriber counts, revenueper user, capital investment and acquisition costs persubscriber, and ongoing operating costs. We based ourassumptions on a combination of our historical results,trends, business plans and marketplace participant data.\\nAnnual Goodwill Testing\\nGoodwill is tested on a reporting unit basis by comparing\\nthe estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its bookvalue. If the fair value exceeds the book value, then noimpairment is measured. We estimate fair values using anincome approach (also known as a discounted cash flowmodel) and a market multiple approach. The incomeapproach utilizes our future cash flow projections with aperpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weightedManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\\n\\t!',\n",

The market multiple approach\\nuses the multiples of publicly traded companies whoseservices are comparable to those offered by the reportingunits.\\nAs of October 1, 2022, the calculated fair value of the\\nMobility reporting unit exceeded its book value and noadditional testing was necessary. If either the projectedrate of long-term growth of Mobility cash flows orrevenues declined by 0.5%, or if the weighted averagecost of capital increased by 0.5%, the fair value would stillbe higher than the book value of the goodwill. In the eventof a 10% drop in the fair value of the Mobility reportingunit, the fair value still would have exceeded the bookvalue of the reporting unit.\\nOur 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in\\nnoncash impairment charges related to our BusinessWireline, Consumer Wireline and Mexico reporting units.The decline in fair values was primarily due to changes inthe macroeconomic environment, namely increasedweighted-average cost of capital. Also, inflation pressureand lower projected cash flows driven by secular declines,predominantly at Business Wireline, impacted the fairvalues. Future sustained declines in macroeconomic orbusiness conditions, or higher discount rates or declines inthe value of AT&T stock could result in goodwillimpairment charges in future periods. A summary ofbusiness unit goodwill impairment by segment andsensitivity analysis is as follows:\\nCommunicationsLatin\\nAmerica\\nBusiness\\nWirelineConsumer\\nWireline Mexico\\nGoodwill as ofOctober 1, 2022: $ 17,903 $ 30,155 $ 826\\nImpairment charge (13,478) (10,508) (826)\\nRemaining Goodwill at\\nDecember 31, 2022 $ 4,425 $ 19,647 $ —\\nSensitivity analysis,\\napproximate hypotheticalimpairment charge:\\nWeighted-average cost of\\ncapital increase of 25 BP $ 1,200 $ 2,200 $ —\\nProjected terminal growth\\nrate decline of 25 BP 700 1,400 —\\nProjected long-term EBITDA\\nmargin decline of 100 BP 1,500 1,300 —\\nU.S. Wireless Licenses\\nThe fair value of U.S. wireless licenses is assessed using a\\ndiscounted cash flow model (the Greenfield Approach)and a qualitative corroborative market approach based onauction prices, depending upon auction activity. TheGreenfield Approach assumes a company initially ownsonly the wireless licenses and makes investments requiredto build an operation comparable to current use. These\\nlicenses are tested annually for impairment on anaggregated basis, consistent with their use on a nationalscope for the United States. For impairment testing, weassume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up toprojected levels, with a long-term growth rate reflectingexpected long-term inflation trends. We assume churnrates will initially exceed our current experience butdecline to rates that are in line with industry-leadingchurn. We used a discount rate of 9.50%, based on theoptimal long-term capital structure of a marketparticipant and its associated cost of debt and equity forthe licenses, to calculate the present value of theprojected cash flows. If either the projected rate of long-term growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 0.5%,or if the discount rate increased by 0.5%, the fair values ofthese wireless licenses would still be higher than the bookvalue of the licenses. The fair value of these wirelesslicenses exceeded their book values by more than 10%.\\nOther Finite-Lived Intangibles\\nCustomer relationships, licenses in Mexico and other\\nfinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairmentwhenever events or circumstances indicate that the bookvalue may not be recoverable over their remaining life. Forthis analysis, we compare the expected undiscountedfuture cash flows attributable to the asset to its bookvalue. When the asset’s book value exceeds undiscountedfuture cash flows, an impairment is recorded to reducethe book value of the asset to its estimated fair value (seeNotes 7 and 9).\\nIncome Taxes Our estimates of income taxes and the\\nsignificant items giving rise to the deferred assets andliabilities are shown in Note 13 and reflect our assessmentof actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in thefinancial statements, giving consideration to both timingand probability of these estimates. Actual income taxescould vary from these estimates due to future changes inincome tax law or the final review of our tax returns byfederal, state or foreign tax authorities.\\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more\\nlikely than not that we will sustain positions that we havetaken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit toinitially recognize within our financial statements. Weregularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust ourunrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) in light of changes infacts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law,interactions with taxing authorities and developments incase law.

       "  'MARKET RISK\\nWe are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in\\ninterest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Theserisks, along with other business risks, impact our cost ofcapital. It is our policy to manage our debt structure andforeign exchange exposure in order to manage capitalcosts, control financial risks and maintain financialflexibility over the long term. In managing market risks, weemploy derivatives according to documented policies andprocedures, including interest rate swaps, interest ratelocks, foreign currency exchange contracts and combinedinterest rate foreign currency contracts (cross-currencyswaps). We do not use derivatives for trading orspeculative purposes. We do not foresee significantchanges in the strategies we use to manage market risk inthe near future.\\nOne of the most significant assumptions used in\\nestimating our postretirement benefit obligations is theassumed weighted-average discount rate, which is thehypothetical rate at which the projected benefitobligations could be effectively settled or paid out toparticipants. We determined our discount rate based on arange of factors, including a yield curve composed of therates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixedincome corporate bonds available at the measurementdate and corresponding to the related expected durationsof future cash outflows for the obligations. In recentyears, the discount rates have been increasingly volatile,and on average have been lower than in historical periods.Lower discount rates used to measure our pension andpostretirement plans result in higher obligations. Futureincreases in these rates could result in lower obligations,improved funded status and actuarial gains.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe majority of our financial instruments are medium-\\nand long-term fixed-rate notes and debentures. Changesin interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in thefair value of these instruments. The principal amounts byexpected maturity, average interest rate and fair value ofour liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk aredescribed in Notes 11 and 12. In managing interestexpense, we control our mix of fixed and floating ratedebt through term loans, floating rate notes, and interestrate swaps. We have established interest rate risk limitsthat we closely monitor by measuring interest ratesensitivities in our debt and interest rate derivativesportfolios.Most of our foreign-denominated long-term debt has\\nbeen swapped from fixed-rate or floating-rate foreigncurrencies to fixed-rate U.S. dollars at issuance throughcross-currency swaps, removing interest rate risk andforeign currency exchange risk associated with theunderlying interest and principal payments. Likewise,periodically we enter into interest rate locks to partiallyhedge the risk of increases in the benchmark interest rateduring the period leading up to the probable issuance offixed-rate debt. We expect gains or losses in our cross-currency swaps and interest rate locks to offset the lossesand gains in the financial instruments they hedge.\\nWe had no interest rate swaps and no interest rate locks\\nat December 31, 2022.\\nForeign Exchange Risk\\nWe principally use foreign exchange contracts to hedge\\ncosts and debt denominated in foreign currencies. We arealso exposed to foreign currency exchange risk throughour foreign affiliates and equity investments in foreigncompanies.\\nThrough cross-currency swaps, most of our foreign-\\ndenominated debt has been swapped from fixed-rate orfloating-rate foreign currencies to fixed-rate U.S. dollarsat issuance, removing interest rate and foreign currencyexchange risk associated with the underlying interest andprincipal payments. We expect gains or losses in ourcross-currency swaps to offset the gains and losses in thefinancial instruments they hedge.

       "  'RISK FACTORS\\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this\\ndocument, including the matters contained under thecaption “Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully read thematters described below. We believe that each of thesematters could materially affect our business. Werecognize that most of these factors are beyond ourability to control and therefore we cannot predict anoutcome.\\nMacro-economic Factors:Adverse changes in the U.S. securities markets,\\ninterest rates, rising inflation and medical costs couldmaterially increase our benefit plan costs and futurefunding requirements.\\nOur costs to provide current benefits and funding for\\nfuture benefits are subject to increases, primarily due tocontinuing increases in medical and prescription drugcosts, in part due to inflation, and can be affected by lowerreturns on assets held by our pension and other benefitplans, which are reflected in our financial statements forthat year. In calculating the recognized benefit costs, wehave made certain assumptions regarding futureinvestment returns, interest rates and medical costs.These assumptions could change significantly over timeand could be materially different than originally projected.Lower than assumed investment returns, an increase inour benefit obligations, and higher than assumed medicaland prescription drug costs will increase expenses.\\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires\\ncompanies to recognize the funded status of definedbenefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset orliability in their statement of financial position and torecognize changes in that funded status in the year inwhich the changes occur. We have elected to reflect theannual adjustments to the funded status in ourconsolidated statement of income. Therefore, an increasein our costs or adverse market conditions will have anegative effect on our operating results.\\nSignificant adverse changes in capital markets could\\nresult in the deterioration of our defined benefit plans’funded status.\\nInflationary pressures on costs, such as inputs for\\ndevices we sell and network components, labor anddistribution costs may impact our networkconstruction, our financial condition or results ofoperations.\\nAs a provider of telecommunications and technology\\nservices, we sell handsets, wireless data cards, wirelesscomputing devices and customer premises equipmentmanufactured by various suppliers for use with our voiceand data services and depend on suppliers to provide us,directly or through other suppliers, with items such asnetwork equipment, customer premises equipment, andwireless-related equipment such as mobile hotspots,handsets, wirelessly enabled computers, wireless datacards and other connected devices for our customers.Beginning in 2021 and continuing through the early part of\\n2023, the costs of these inputs and the costs of labornecessary to develop, deploy and maintain our networksand our products and services rapidly increased. Inaddition, many of these inputs are subject to pricefluctuations from a number of factors, including, but notlimited to, market conditions, demand for raw materialsused in the production of these devices and networkcomponents, weather, climate change, energy costs,currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, governmentalactions, import and export requirements (includingtariffs), and other factors beyond our control. Inflationaryand supply pressures may continue into the future andcould have an adverse impact on our ability to sourcematerials.\\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as\\nthrough increases in the selling prices of some of ourproducts and services, may not be successful. Higherproduct prices may result in reductions in sales volume.Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differentialfor our products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchasesaltogether, during a period of inflationary pressure or aneconomic downturn. To the extent that price increasesare not sufficient to offset these increased costsadequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result insignificant decreases in sales volume, our business,financial condition or operating results may be adverselyaffected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset anycost increases through productivity and cost-savinginitiatives.\\nAdverse changes in global financial markets could limit\\nour ability and our larger customers’ ability to accesscapital or increase the cost of capital needed to fundbusiness operations.\\nDuring 2022, uncertainty surrounding global growth rates,\\ninflation, an increasing interest rate environment and theimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to producevolatility in the credit, currency and equity markets.Volatility may affect companies’ access to the creditmarkets, leading to higher borrowing costs, or, in somecases, the inability to fund ongoing operations. In addition,we contract with large financial institutions to support ourown treasury operations, including contracts to hedge ourexposure on interest rates and foreign exchange and thefunding of credit lines and other short-term debtobligations, including commercial paper. These financialinstitutions face stricter capital-related and otherregulations in the United States and Europe, as well asongoing legal and financial issues concerning their loanportfolios, which may hamper their ability to providecredit or raise the cost of providing such credit.\\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the\\nLondon Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR), has announcedthat it intends to phase out LIBOR in 2023. Although oursecurities and other debt obligations may provide foralternative methods of calculating the interest rate\\n ?',\n",

A company’s cost of borrowing is also affected byevaluations given by various credit rating agencies andthese agencies have been applying tighter creditstandards when evaluating debt levels and future growthprospects. While we have been successful in continuing toaccess the credit and fixed income markets when needed,adverse changes in the financial markets could render useither unable to access these markets or able to accessthese markets only at higher interest costs and withrestrictive financial or other conditions, severely affectingour business operations. Additionally, downgrades of ourcredit rating by the major credit rating agencies couldincrease our cost of borrowing and also impact thecollateral we would be required to post under certainagreements we have entered into with our derivativecounterparties, which could negatively impact ourliquidity. Further, valuation changes in our derivativeportfolio due to interest rates and foreign exchange ratescould require us to post collateral and thus may negativelyimpact our liquidity.\\nOur international operations increase our exposure to\\npolitical instability, to changes in the internationaleconomy and to regulation on our business and theserisks could offset our expected growth opportunities.\\nWe have international operations, particularly in Mexico,\\nand other countries worldwide where we need to complywith a wide variety of complex local laws, regulations andtreaties. In addition, we are exposed to, among otherfactors, fluctuations in currency values, changes inrelationships between U.S. and foreign governments, waror other hostilities, and other regulations that maymaterially affect our earnings. Involvement with foreignfirms also exposes us to the risk of being unable to controlthe actions of those firms and therefore exposes us torisks associated with our obligation to comply with theForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Violations of theFCPA could have a material adverse effect on ouroperating results.\\nIndustry-wide Factors:\\nOur business is subject to risks related to the COVID-19\\nvirus.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting mitigation\\nmeasures have caused, and may continue to cause, anegative effect on our operating results. These effectsinclude, but are not limited to closure of retail stores;impact on our customers’ ability to pay for our productsand services; reduction in international roaming revenue;and reduced staffing levels in call centers and fieldoperations. We may also incur significantly higherexpenses attributable to infrastructure investmentsrequired to meet higher network utilization from morecustomers consuming bandwidth from changes in workfrom home trends; extended cancellation periods; andincreased labor costs if the COVID-19 pandemic continues\\nfor an extended period.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have\\ncaused, and may continue to cause, adverse impacts onglobal supply chains and economic conditions. Theseimpacts could affect our network development,deployment and maintenance, and the demand for ourproducts and services. The extent to which the COVID-19pandemic impacts our business, results of operations,cash flows and financial condition will depend on futuredevelopments that are highly uncertain and cannot bepredicted, including new information that may emergeconcerning other strains of the virus and the actions tocontain its impact.\\nChanges to federal, state and foreign government\\nregulations and decisions in regulatory proceedings, aswell as private litigation, could further increase ouroperating costs and/or alter customer perceptions ofour operations, which could materially adverselyaffect us.\\nOur subsidiaries providing wired services are subject to\\nsignificant federal and state regulation while many of ourcompetitors are not. In addition, our subsidiaries andaffiliates operating outside the United States are alsosubject to the jurisdiction of national and supranationalregulatory authorities in the market where service isprovided. Our wireless subsidiaries are regulated tovarying degrees by the FCC and in some instances, bystate and local agencies. Adverse regulations and rulingsby the FCC relating to broadband and wirelessdeployment could impede our ability to manage ournetworks and recover costs and lessen incentives toinvest in our networks. The continuing growth of IP-basedservices, especially when accessed by wireless devices, hascreated or potentially could create conflicting regulationbetween the FCC and various state and local authorities,which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and mayresult in outcomes unfavorable to us. In addition, inresponse to the FAA questioning whether our 5G C-bandlaunch could impact radio altimeter equipment onairplanes, we voluntarily committed to a series oftemporary, precautionary measures, in addition todeferring turning on a limited number of towers aroundcertain airports to allow the FAA more time to evaluate.These measures have been subsequently modified fromtime to time. The FAA’s continued evaluation may impactour planned 5G C-band launch in certain areas. In addition,increased public focus on a variety of issues related to ouroperations, such as privacy issues, government requestsor orders for customer data, and concerns about globalclimate changes, have led to proposals or new legislationat state, federal and foreign government levels to changeor increase regulation on our operations. Enactment ofnew privacy laws and regulations could, among otherthings, adversely affect our ability to collect and offertargeted advertisements or result in additional costs ofManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\\n !',\n",

Should customers decide that\\nour competitors offer a more customer-friendlyenvironment, our competitive position, results ofoperations or financial condition could be materiallyadversely affected.\\nEffects of climate change may impose risk of damage\\nto our infrastructure, our ability to provide services,and may cause changes in federal, state and foreigngovernment regulation, all of which may result inpotential adverse impact to our financial results.\\nExtreme weather events precipitated by long-term\\nclimate change have the potential to directly damagenetwork facilities or disrupt our ability to build andmaintain portions of our network and could potentiallydisrupt suppliers’ ability to provide products and servicesrequired to provide reliable network coverage. Any suchdisruption could delay network deployment plans,interrupt service for our customers, increase our costsand have a negative effect on our operating results. Thepotential physical effects of climate change, such asincreased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires,freezing conditions, sea-level rise and other climate-related events, could adversely affect our operations,infrastructure and financial results. Operational impactsresulting from the potential physical effects of climatechange, such as damage to our network infrastructure,could result in increased costs and loss of revenue. Wecould incur significant costs to improve the climateresiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for,respond to, and mitigate such physical effects of climatechange. We are not able to accurately predict themateriality of any potential losses or costs associatedwith the physical effects of climate change.\\nFurther, customers, consumers, investors and other\\nstakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmentalissues, including climate change, water use, deforestation,plastic waste and other sustainability concerns. Concernover climate change or other environmental, social andgovernance (ESG) matters may result in new or increasedlegal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigateimpacts to the environment and reduce the impact of ourbusiness on climate change. Further, climate changeregulations may require us to alter our proposed businessplans or increase our operating costs due to increasedregulation or environmental considerations, and couldadversely affect our business and reputation.\\nContinuing growth in and the converging nature of\\nwireless and broadband services will require us todeploy significant amounts of capital and requireongoing access to spectrum in order to provideattractive services to customers.\\nWireless and broadband services are undergoing rapid and\\nsignificant technological changes and a dramatic increasein usage, including, in particular, the demand for faster andseamless usage of data, including video, across mobile andfixed devices. The COVID-19 pandemic has acceleratedthese changes and also resulted in higher networkutilization, as more customers consume bandwidth fromchanges in work and learn from home trends. We must\\ncontinually invest in our networks in order to improve ourwireless and broadband services to meet this increasingdemand and changes in customer expectations whileremaining competitive. Improvements in these servicesdepend on many factors, including continued access toand deployment of adequate spectrum and the capitalneeded to expand our wireline network to supporttransport of these services. In order to stem broadbandsubscriber losses to cable competitors in our non-fiberwireline areas, we have been expanding our all-fiberwireline network. We must maintain and expand ournetwork capacity and coverage for transport of data,including video, and voice between cell and fixed landlinesites. To this end, we participate in spectrum auctions andcontinue to deploy software and other technologyadvancements in order to efficiently invest in ournetwork.\\nWe have spent, and plan to continue spending, significant\\ncapital and other resources on the ongoing developmentand deployment of our 5G and fiber wireline networks.This deployment and other network serviceenhancements and product launches may not occur asscheduled or at the cost expected due to many factors,including unexpected inflation, delays in determiningequipment and wireless handset operating standards,supplier delays, software issues, increases in network andhandset component costs, regulatory permitting delaysfor tower sites or enhancements, or labor-related delays.Deployment of new technology also may adversely affectthe performance of the network for existing services. Ifwe cannot acquire needed spectrum, our 5G and fiberofferings fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or weotherwise fail to deploy the services customers desire ona timely basis with acceptable quality and at reasonablecosts, then our ability to attract and retain customers,and, therefore, maintain and improve our operatingmargins, could be materially adversely affected.\\nIncreasing competition for wireless customers could\\nmaterially adversely affect our operating results.\\nWe have multiple wireless competitors in each of our\\nservice areas and compete for customers basedprincipally on service/device offerings, price, networkquality, coverage area and customer service. In addition,we are facing growing competition from providersoffering services using advanced wireless technologiesand IP-based networks. We expect market saturation tocontinue to cause the wireless industry’s customergrowth rate to moderate in comparison with historicalgrowth rates, leading to increased competition forcustomers. Our share of industry sales could be reduceddue to aggressive pricing or promotional strategiespursued by competitors. We also expect that ourcustomers’ growing demand for high-speed video anddata services will place constraints on our networkcapacity. These competition and capacity constraints willcontinue to put pressure on pricing and margins ascompanies compete for potential customers. Our abilityto respond will depend, among other things, on continued\\n ¿',\n",
       "  'improvement in network quality and customer service and\\nour ability to price our products and servicescompetitively as well as effective marketing of attractiveproducts and services. These efforts will involvesignificant expenses and require strategic managementdecisions on, and timely implementation of, equipmentchoices, network deployment and service offerings.\\nIntellectual property rights may be inadequate to take\\nadvantage of business opportunities, which maymaterially adversely affect our operations.\\nEffective intellectual property protection may not be\\navailable in every country where we operate. We mayneed to spend significant amounts of money to protectour rights. Any impairment of our intellectual propertyrights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreignintellectual property laws or the absence of effective legalprotections or enforcement measures, could materiallyadversely impact our operations.\\nIncidents leading to damage to our reputation, and any\\nresulting lawsuits, claims or other legal proceedings,could have a material adverse effect on our business.\\nWe believe that our brand image, awareness and\\nreputation strengthen our relationship with consumersand contribute significantly to the success of our business.We strive to create a culture in which our colleagues actwith integrity and respect and feel comfortable speakingup to report instances of misconduct or other concerns.Our ability to attract and retain employees is highlydependent upon our commitment to a diverse andinclusive workplace, ethical business practices and otherqualities. Acts of misconduct by any employee, andparticularly by senior management, could erode trust andconfidence and damage our reputation. Negative publicopinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by usor those currently or formerly associated with us, andfrom any number of activities or circumstances, includingoperations, employment-related offenses (such as sexualharassment and discrimination), regulatory complianceand actions taken by regulators or others in response tosuch conduct. Any damage to our reputation or paymentsof significant amounts, even if reserved, could materiallyand adversely affect our business, reputation, financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows. Wecurrently are, and may in the future be, named as adefendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedingsthat arise in the ordinary course of our business based onalleged acts of misconduct by employees. These actionsseek, among other things, compensation for allegedpersonal injury (including claims for loss of life), workers’compensation, employment discrimination, sexualharassment, workplace misconduct, wage and hour claimsand other employment-related damages, compensationfor breach of contract, statutory or regulatory claims,negligence or gross negligence, punitive damages,consequential damages, and civil penalties or other lossesor injunctive or declaratory relief. The outcome of anyallegations, lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings isinherently uncertain and could result in significant costs,damage to our brands or reputation and diversion ofmanagement’s attention from our business.Company-Specific Financial Factors:\\nCustomer adoption of new software-based\\ntechnologies may require higher quality services fromus, and meeting these demands could create supplychain issues and could increase capital costs.\\nThe communications industry has experienced rapid\\nchanges in the past several years. An increasing numberof our customers are using mobile devices as theirprimary means of viewing video. In addition, businessesand government bodies are broadly shifting to wireless-based services for homes and infrastructure to improveservices to their respective customers and constituencies.We have spent, and continue to spend, significant capitalto shift our wired network to software-based technologyto manage this demand and are expanding 5G wirelesstechnology to address these consumer demands. We areentering into a significant number of software licensingagreements and working with software developers toprovide network functions in lieu of installing switches orother physical network equipment in order to respond torapid developments in wireless demand. While software-based functionality can be changed much more quicklythan, for example, physical switches, the rapid pace ofdevelopment means that we may increasingly need to relyon single-source and software solutions that have notpreviously been deployed in production environments.Should this software not function as intended or ourlicense agreements provide inadequate protection fromintellectual property infringement claims, we could beforced to either substitute (if available) or else spend timeto develop alternative technologies at a much higher costand incur harm to our reputation for reliability, and, as aresult, our ability to remain competitive could bematerially adversely affected.\\nWe depend on various suppliers to provide equipment\\nto operate our business and satisfy customer demandand interruption or delay in supply can adverselyimpact our operating results.\\nWe depend on suppliers to provide us, directly or through\\nother suppliers, with items such as network equipment,customer premises equipment and wireless-relatedequipment such as mobile hotspots, handsets, wirelesslyenabled computers, wireless data cards and otherconnected devices for our customers. These supplierscould fail to provide equipment on a timely or costeffective basis, or fail to meet our performanceexpectations, for a number of reasons, includingdifficulties in obtaining export licenses for certaintechnologies, inflationary pressures, inability to securecomponent parts, general business disruption, naturaldisasters, safety issues, economic and political instability,including the outbreak of war and other hostilities, andpublic health emergencies such as the COVID-19pandemic. These factors have caused, and may againcause, delays in the development, manufacturing(including the sourcing of key components) and shipmentof products to the extent that we or our suppliers areimpacted.

It ispossible that, in some circumstances, we could be forcedto switch to a different key supplier or be unable to meetcustomer demand for certain products or services.Because of the cost and time lag that can be associatedwith transitioning from one supplier to another, ourbusiness could be substantially disrupted if we wererequired to, or chose to, replace the products of one ormore key suppliers with products from another source,especially if the replacement became necessary on shortnotice. Any such disruption could increase our costs,decrease our operating efficiencies and have a negativeeffect on our operating results.\\nIncreasing costs to provide services and failure to\\nrenew agreements on favorable terms, or at all, couldadversely affect operating margins.\\nOur operating costs, including customer acquisition and\\nretention costs, could continue to put pressure onmargins and customer retention levels.\\nA number of our competitors offering comparable legacy\\nservices that rely on alternative technologies and businessmodels are typically subject to less regulation, andtherefore are able to operate with lower costs. Thesecompetitors generally can focus on discrete customersegments since they do not have regulatory obligations toprovide universal service. Also, these competitors havecost advantages compared to us, due in part to operatingon newer, more technically advanced and lower-costnetworks with a nonunionized workforce, lower employeebenefits and fewer retirees. We are transitioning servicesfrom our old copper-based network and seekingregulatory approvals, where needed, at both the state andfederal levels. If we do not obtain regulatory approvals forour network transition or obtain approvals with onerousconditions, we could experience significant cost andcompetitive disadvantages.\\nWe may not realize or sustain the expected benefits\\nfrom our business transformation initiatives and theseefforts could have a materially adverse effect on ourbusiness, operations, financial condition, results ofoperations and competitive position.\\nWe have been and will be undertaking certain\\ntransformation initiatives, including the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction, which are designed to reducecosts, streamline and modernize distribution andcustomer service, remove redundancies and simplify andimprove processes and support functions. Our focus is onsupporting added customer value with an improvedcustomer experience. We intend for these efficiencies toenable increased investments in our strategic areas offocus, which consist of improving broadband connectivity(for example, fiber and 5G). We also expect theseinitiatives to drive efficiencies and improved margins. If wedo not successfully manage and execute these initiatives,or if they are inadequate or ineffective, we may fail tomeet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits,\\nimprovements may be delayed, not sustained or notrealized, and our business, operations and competitiveposition could be adversely affected.\\nUnfavorable litigation or governmental investigation\\nresults could require us to pay significant amounts orlead to onerous operating procedures.\\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits both in the United\\nStates and in foreign countries, including, at any particulartime, claims relating to antitrust, patent infringement,wage and hour, personal injury, customer privacyviolations, regulatory proceedings, breach of contract, andselling and collection practices. We also spend substantialresources complying with various government standards,which may entail related investigations and litigation. Inthe wireless area, we also face current and potentiallitigation relating to alleged adverse health effects oncustomers or employees who use such technologiesincluding, for example, wireless devices. We may incursignificant expenses defending such suits or governmentcharges and may be required to pay amounts orotherwise change our operations in ways that couldmaterially adversely affect our operations or financialresults.\\nCyberattacks impacting our networks or systems may\\nhave a material adverse affect on our operations.\\nCyberattacks, including through the use of malware,\\ncomputer viruses, distributed denial of services attacks,ransomware attacks, credential harvesting, socialengineering and other means for obtaining unauthorizedaccess to or disrupting the operation of our networks andsystems and those of our suppliers, vendors and otherservice providers, could have a material adverse effect onour operations. Cyberattacks can cause equipment ornetwork failures, loss of information, including sensitivepersonal information of customers or employees orproprietary information, as well as disruptions to our orour customers’, suppliers’ or vendors’ operations, whichcould result in significant expenses, potentialinvestigations and legal liability, a loss of current or futurecustomers and reputational damage. Our wired networkin particular is becoming increasingly reliant on softwareas it evolves to handle growing demands for videotransmission. Cyberattacks against companies, includingthe Company and its suppliers and vendors, have occurredand will continue to occur and have increased infrequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Thedevelopment and maintenance of systems to preventsuch attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoringand updating. While, to date, we have not been subject tocyberattacks that, individually or in the aggregate, havebeen material to our operations or financial condition, thepreventive actions we take to reduce the risks associatedwith cyberattacks may be insufficient to repel or mitigatethe effects of a major cyberattack in the future.\\n.\\t',\n",

       "  'NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\\nPOLICIES\\nBasis of Presentation Throughout this document, AT&T\\nInc. is referred to as “AT&T,” “we” or the “Company.” Theconsolidated financial statements include the accounts ofthe Company and subsidiaries and affiliates which wecontrol. AT&T is a holding company whose subsidiariesand affiliates operate worldwide in thetelecommunications and technology industries.\\nOn April 8, 2022, we completed the separation of our\\nWarnerMedia business, which represented substantially allof our WarnerMedia segment, in a Reverse Morris Trusttransaction, under which Magallanes, Inc. (Spinco), aformerly wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T that held theWarnerMedia business, was distributed to AT&Tstockholders via a pro rata dividend, followed by thecombination of Spinco with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc.(Discovery), which was renamed Warner Bros. Discovery,Inc. (WBD). (See Note 6)\\nUpon the separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia\\nbusiness met the criteria for discontinued operations. Fordiscontinued operations, we also evaluated transactionsthat were components of AT&T’s single plan of a strategicshift, including dispositions that previously did notindividually meet the criteria due to materiality, and havedetermined discontinued operations to be comprised ofWarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic).These businesses are reflected in the accompanyingfinancial statements as discontinued operations, includingfor periods prior to the consummation of theWarnerMedia/Discovery transaction. (See Notes 6 and 23)\\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG\\nCapital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTVEntertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close ofthe transaction, we separated and deconsolidated ourVideo business, comprised of our U.S. video operations,and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTVunder the equity method (see Notes 6, 10 and 19).\\nAll significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in\\nthe consolidation process. Investments in subsidiaries andpartnerships which we do not control but have significantinfluence are accounted for under the equity method.Earnings from certain investments accounted for usingthe equity method are included in our results on a onequarter lag. We also record our proportionate share of ourequity method investees’ other comprehensive income(OCI) items, including translation adjustments. We treatdistributions received from equity method investees asreturns on investment and classify them as cash flowsfrom operating activities until those distributions exceedour cumulative equity in the earnings of that investment.We treat the excess amount as a return of investment andclassify it as cash flows from investing activities.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity\\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)requires management to make estimates andassumptions, including other estimates of fair value,\\nprobable losses and expenses, that affect the amountsreported in the financial statements and accompanyingnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Moreover, unfavorable changes in market conditions,including interest rates, could adversely impact thoseestimates and result in asset impairments. Certain prior-period amounts have been conformed to the currentperiod’s presentation. Unless otherwise noted, theinformation in Notes 1 through 22 and 24 refer only to ourcontinuing operations and do not include discussion ofbalances or activity of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr andPlaydemic, which are part of discontinued operations.\\nAdopted and New Accounting StandardsConvertible Instruments Beginning with 2022 interim\\nreporting, we adopted, through retrospective application,the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB)Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, “Debt—Debt With Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts inEntity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting forConvertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s OwnEquity” (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 requires thatinstruments which may be settled in cash or stock arepresumed settled in stock in calculating diluted earningsper share. While our intent is to settle the Series ACumulative Perpetual Membership Interests in AT&TMobility II LLC (Mobility preferred interests) in cash,settlement of this instrument in AT&T shares would resultin additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which isinfluenced by the fair value of the Mobility preferredinterests and the average AT&T common stock priceduring the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period (see Note 16).\\nThe following table presents the impact of the adoption\\nof ASU 2020-06 on our diluted earnings per share fromcontinuing operations:\\nDiluted earnings per share from\\ncontinuing operations:Historical\\nAccounting\\nMethodEffect of\\nAdoption\\nof ASU\\n2020-061Under ASU\\n2020-06\\nYear ended December 31, 2022 $ (1.10) $ — $ (1.10)\\nYear ended December 31, 2021 $ 3.07 $ (0.05) $ 3.02\\nYear ended December 31, 2020 $ (0.45) $ — $ (0.45)\\n1See Note 2 for a discussion of the numerator and denominator adjustments.\\nReference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued\\nASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform onFinancial Reporting” (ASU 2020-04, as amended), whichprovides optional expedients, and allows for certainexceptions to existing GAAP, for contract modificationstriggered by the expected market transition of certainbenchmark interest rates to alternative reference rates.ASU 2020-04 applies to contracts, hedging relationships,Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\\n:\\x08',\n",

ASU2020-04, as amended, became effective immediately. Wedo not believe our adoption of ASU 2020-04, includingoptional expedients, will materially impact our financialstatements.\\nGovernment Assistance In November 2021, the FASB\\nissued ASU No. 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic832): Disclosures by Business Entities about GovernmentAssistance” (ASU 2021-10), which requires annualdisclosures (e.g., terms and conditions, accountingtreatment, impacted financial statement lines), in thenotes to the financial statements, about transactions witha government that are accounted for by applying a grantor contribution accounting model by analogy to otherguidance. We adopted ASU 2021-10 effective for theannual reporting period ended December 31, 2022, asrequired, under prospective application, with no requiredupdates to our disclosures.\\nCredit Losses As of January 1, 2020, we adopted,\\nthrough modified retrospective application, ASU No.2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326):Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,”or Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326 (ASC 326),which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodologyunder prior GAAP with an expected credit loss model. ASC326 affects trade receivables, loans, contract assets,certain beneficial interests, off-balance-sheet creditexposures not accounted for as insurance and otherfinancial assets that are not subject to fair value throughnet income, as defined by the standard. Under theexpected credit loss model, we are required to considerfuture economic trends to estimate expected creditlosses over the lifetime of the asset. Upon adoption onJanuary 1, 2020, we recorded a $293 reduction to“Retained earnings,” $395 increase to “Allowances forcredit losses” applicable to our trade and loan receivables,$10 reduction of contract assets, $105 reduction of netdeferred income tax liability and $7 reduction of“Noncontrolling interest.” Our adoption of ASC 326 did nothave a material impact on our financial statements.\\nSupplier Finance Obligations In September 2022, the\\nFASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, “Liabilities – SupplierFinance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure ofSupplier Finance Program Obligations” (ASU 2022-04),which establishes interim and annual reporting disclosurerequirements about a company’s supplier financeprograms for its purchase of goods and services. Interimand annual requirements include disclosure ofoutstanding amounts under the obligations as of the endof the reporting period, and annual requirements include arollforward of those obligations for the annual reportingperiod, as well as a description of payment and other keyterms of the programs. ASU 2022-04 will be effective forinterim and annual periods beginning after December 15,2022, with retrospective application, except for the annualrollforward requirement, which becomes effective forannual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, with\\nprospective application. The standard allows earlyadoption of all requirements. In the year of adoption, thedisclosure of payment and other key terms under theprograms and outstanding balances under the obligationswill also apply to interim reporting dates. We are in theprocess of evaluating the impact of our adoption of ASU2022-04.\\nAccounting PoliciesIncome Taxes We record deferred income taxes for\\ntemporary differences between the carrying amounts ofassets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes andthe computed tax basis of those assets and liabilities. Werecord valuation allowances against the deferred taxassets (included, together with our deferred income taxassets, as part of our reportable net deferred income taxliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets), for whichthe realization is uncertain. We review these itemsregularly in light of changes in federal, state and foreigntax laws and changes in our business.\\nAs of January 1, 2021, we adopted, with modified\\nretrospective application, the FASB’s ASU No. 2019-12,“Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting forIncome Taxes” (ASU 2019-12), which simplified income taxaccounting requirements in areas deemed costly andcomplex. ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact onour financial statements.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents\\ninclude all highly liquid investments with originalmaturities of three months or less. The carrying amountsapproximate fair value. At December 31, 2022, we held$866 in cash and $2,835 in money market funds and othercash equivalents. Of our total cash and cash equivalents,$1,045 resided in foreign jurisdictions, some of which issubject to restrictions on repatriation.\\nAllowance for Credit Losses We record expense to\\nmaintain an allowance for credit losses for estimatedlosses that result from the failure or inability of ourcustomers to make required payments deemed collectiblefrom the customer when the service was provided orproduct was delivered. When determining the allowancesfor trade receivables and loans, we consider theprobability of recoverability of accounts receivable basedon past experience, taking into account current collectiontrends and general economic factors, includingbankruptcy rates. We also consider future economictrends to estimate expected credit losses over thelifetime of the asset. Credit risks are assessed based onhistorical write-offs, net of recoveries, as well as ananalysis of the aged accounts receivable balances withallowances generally increasing as the receivable ages.Accounts receivable may be fully reserved for whenspecific collection issues are known to exist, such ascatastrophes or pending bankruptcies.\\n:\\t',\n",
       "  'Inventories Inventories primarily consist of wireless\\ndevices and accessories and are valued at the lower ofcost or net realizable value.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and\\nequipment is stated at cost, except for assets acquiredusing acquisition accounting, which are initially recordedat fair value (see Note 7). The cost of additions andsubstantial improvements to property, plant andequipment is capitalized, and includes internalcompensation costs for these projects. The cost ofmaintenance and repairs of property, plant andequipment is charged to operating expenses. Property,plant and equipment costs are depreciated using straight-line methods over their estimated economic lives. Certainsubsidiaries follow composite group depreciationmethodology. Accordingly, when a portion of theirdepreciable property, plant and equipment is retired in theordinary course of business, the gross book value isreclassified to accumulated depreciation, and no gain orloss is recognized on the disposition of these assets.\\nProperty, plant and equipment is reviewed for\\nrecoverability whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of anasset group may not be recoverable. We recognize animpairment loss when the carrying amount of a long-livedasset is not recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of theundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the useand eventual disposition of the asset. (See Note 7)\\nThe liability for the fair value of an asset retirement\\nobligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred ifa reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Inperiods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognizeperiod-to-period changes in the liability resulting from thepassage of time and revisions to either the timing or theamount of the original estimate. The increase in thecarrying value of the associated long-lived asset isdepreciated over the corresponding estimated economiclife.\\nSoftware Costs We capitalize certain costs incurred in\\nconnection with developing or obtaining internal-usesoftware. Capitalized software costs are included in“Property, Plant and Equipment – Net” on our consolidatedbalance sheets. In addition, there is certain networksoftware that allows the equipment to provide thefeatures and functions unique to the AT&T network, whichwe include in the cost of the equipment categories forfinancial reporting purposes.\\nWe amortize our capitalized software costs over a three-\\nyear to seven-year period, reflecting the estimated periodduring which these assets will remain in service.\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have the\\nfollowing major classes of intangible assets: goodwill;licenses, which include Federal CommunicationsCommission (FCC) and other wireless licenses; trademarksand trade names; customer lists; and various other finite-lived intangible assets (see Note 9).Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over\\nthe fair value of identifiable net assets acquired inbusiness combinations. Wireless licenses provide us withthe exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequencyspectrum to provide wireless communications services.While wireless licenses are issued for a fixed period of time(generally ten years), renewals of domestic wirelesslicenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Wehave determined that there are currently no legal,regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or otherfactors that limit the useful lives of our FCC wirelesslicenses.\\nWe amortize our wireless licenses in Mexico over their\\naverage remaining economic life of 25 years.\\nWe acquired the rights to the AT&T and other trade\\nnames in previous acquisitions, classifying certain of thosetrade names as indefinite-lived. We have the effectiveability to retain these exclusive rights permanently at anominal cost.\\nGoodwill, FCC wireless licenses and other indefinite-lived\\nintangible assets are not amortized but are tested at leastannually for impairment (see Note 9). The testing isperformed on the value as of October 1 each year andcompares the book values of the assets to their fairvalues. Goodwill is tested by comparing the carryingamount of each reporting unit, deemed to be our principaloperating segments or one level below them, to the fairvalue using both discounted cash flow as well as marketmultiple approaches. FCC wireless licenses are tested onan aggregate basis, consistent with our use of the licenseson a national scope, using a discounted cash flowapproach. Trade names are tested by comparing theirbook values to their fair values calculated using adiscounted cash flow approach on a presumed royaltyrate derived from the revenues related to each brandname.\\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives are\\namortized over their estimated economic lives (see Note9). Customer lists and relationships are amortized usingprimarily the sum-of-the-months-digits method ofamortization over the period in which those relationshipsare expected to contribute to our future cash flows.Finite-lived trademarks and trade names are amortizedusing the straight-line method over the estimated usefullife of the assets. The remaining finite-lived intangibleassets are generally amortized using the straight-linemethod. These assets, along with other long-lived assets,are reviewed for recoverability whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the carryingamount of an asset group may not be recoverable.\\nAdvertising Costs We expense advertising costs for\\nproducts and services or for promoting our corporateimage as incurred (see Note 22).Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\\n: ',\n",
       "  'Foreign Currency Translation Our foreign subsidiaries\\nand foreign investments generally report their earnings intheir local currencies. We translate their foreign assetsand liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the balancesheet dates. We translate their revenues and expensesusing average rates during the year. The resulting foreigncurrency translation adjustments are recorded as aseparate component of accumulated OCI in ourconsolidated balance sheets (see Note 3).We hedge a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk\\ninvolved in certain foreign currency-denominatedtransactions, which we explain further in our discussion ofour methods of managing our foreign currency risk (seeNote 12).\\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits See Note 14\\nfor a comprehensive discussion of our pension andpostretirement benefits, including a discussion of theactuarial assumptions, our policy for recognizing theassociated gains and losses and our method used toestimate service and interest cost components.\\nNOTE 2.

While our intent is to settlethe Mobility preferred interests in cash, the ability to settle this instrument in AT&T shares will result in additional dilutiveimpact, the magnitude of which is influenced by the fair value of the Mobility preferred interests and the average AT&Tcommon stock price during the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period. The numerator includes anadjustment to add back to income from continuing operations the earned distributions on the Mobility preferredinterests, included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, and the denominator includes the potentialissuance of AT&T common stock to settle the Mobility preferred interests outstanding.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\\nOur segments are comprised of strategic business units\\nor other operations that offer products and services todifferent customer segments over various technologyplatforms and/or in different geographies that aremanaged accordingly. We have two reportable segments:Communications and Latin America.\\nWe also evaluate segment and business unit performance\\nbased on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin, which is definedas operating income excluding depreciation andamortization. EBITDA is used as part of our managementreporting and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant anduseful measurement to our investors as it measures thecash generation potential of our business units. EBITDAdoes not give effect to depreciation and amortizationexpenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdenedby cash used for debt service requirements and thus doesnot reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestmentor other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDAdivided by total revenue.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified into “Corporate”\\ncertain administrative costs borne by AT&T where thebusiness units do not influence decision making toconform with the current period presentation. This recastincreased Corporate operations and support expenses byapproximately $270 and $1,310 for full-year 2021 and 2020,\\nrespectively. Correspondingly, this recast loweredadministrative expenses for the Communicationssegment and Video (our former U.S. video operationscontributed to DIRECTV in July 2021), with no change on aconsolidated basis.\\nTheCommunications segment provides wireless and\\nwireline telecom and broadband services to consumerslocated in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our businessstrategies reflect bundled product offerings that cutacross product lines and utilize shared assets. Thissegment contains the following business units:\\n•Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and\\nequipment.\\n•Business Wireline provides advanced ethernet-based\\nfiber services, IP Voice and managed professionalservices, as well as traditional voice and data servicesand related equipment to business customers.\\n•Consumer Wireline provides broadband services,\\nincluding fiber connections that provide our multi-gigservices to residential customers in select locations.Consumer Wireline also provides legacy telephonyvoice communication services.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\\n::',\n",

No customer accounted formore than 10% of consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 or2020.\\nWireless, Advanced Data, Legacy Voice & Data Services and\\nEquipment Revenue\\nWe offer service-only contracts and contracts that bundle\\nequipment used to access the services and/or with otherservice offerings. Some contracts have fixed terms andothers are cancellable on a short-term basis (i.e., month-to-month arrangements).\\nExamples of service revenues include wireless, strategic\\nservices (e.g., virtual private network service), and legacyvoice and data (e.g., traditional local and long-distance).These services represent a series of distinct services thatis considered a separate performance obligation. Servicerevenue is recognized when services are provided, basedupon either usage (e.g., minutes of traffic/bytes of dataprocessed) or period of time (e.g., monthly service fees).\\nSome of our services require customer premises\\nequipment that, when combined and integrated withAT&T’s specific network infrastructure, facilitates thedelivery of service to the customer. In evaluating whetherthe equipment is a separate performance obligation, weconsider the customer’s ability to benefit from theequipment on its own or together with other readilyavailable resources and if so, whether the service andequipment are separately identifiable (i.e., is the servicehighly dependent on, or highly interrelated with theequipment). When equipment is a separate performanceobligation, we record the sale of equipment when title haspassed and the products are accepted by the customer.For devices sold through indirect channels (e.g., nationaldealers), revenue is recognized when the dealer acceptsthe device, not upon activation.\\nOur equipment and service revenues are predominantly\\nrecognized on a gross basis, as most of our services donot involve a third party and we typically control theequipment that is sold to our customers.\\nRevenue recognized from fixed term contracts that\\nbundle services and/or equipment is allocated based onthe standalone selling price of all required performanceobligations of the contract (i.e., each item included in thebundle). Promotional discounts are attributed to eachrequired component of the arrangement, resulting inrecognition over the contract term. Standalone selling\\nprices are determined by assessing prices paid for service-only contracts (e.g., arrangements where customers bringtheir own devices) and standalone device pricing.\\nWe offer the majority of our customers the option to\\npurchase certain wireless devices in installments over aspecified period of time, and, in many cases, they may beeligible to trade in the original equipment for a new deviceand have the remaining unpaid balance paid or settled. Forcustomers that elect these equipment installmentpayment programs, at the point of sale, we recognizerevenue for the entire amount of revenue allocated to thecustomer receivable net of fair value of the trade-in rightguarantee. The difference between the revenuerecognized and the consideration received is recorded asa note receivable when the devices are not discountedand our right to consideration is unconditional. Wheninstallment sales include promotional discounts (e.g., “buyone get one free” or equipment discounts with trade-in ofa device), the difference between revenue recognized andconsideration received is recorded as a contract asset tobe amortized over the contract term.\\nLess commonly, we offer certain customers highly\\ndiscounted devices when they enter into a minimumservice agreement term. For these contracts, werecognize equipment revenue at the point of sale basedon a standalone selling price allocation. The differencebetween the revenue recognized and the cash received isrecorded as a contract asset that will amortize over thecontract term.\\nOur contracts allow for customers to frequently modify\\ntheir arrangement, without incurring penalties in manycases. When a contract is modified, we evaluate thechange in scope or price of the contract to determine ifthe modification should be treated as a new contract or ifit should be considered a change of the existing contract.We generally do not have significant impacts fromcontract modifications.\\nRevenues from transactions between us and our\\ncustomers are recorded net of revenue-based regulatoryfees and taxes. Cash incentives given to customers arerecorded as a reduction of revenue. Nonrefundable,upfront service activation and setup fees associated withservice arrangements are deferred and recognized overthe associated service contract period or customerrelationship life.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\\n:!',\n",

The\\ndecline in fair values was primarily due to changes in themacroeconomic environment, namely increasedweighted-average cost of capital.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\\nInvestments in partnerships, joint ventures and less than\\nmajority-owned subsidiaries in which we have significantinfluence are accounted for under the equity method.\\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to\\nform a new company named DIRECTV (see Note 6). Thetransaction resulted in our deconsolidation of the Videobusiness, with DIRECTV being accounted for under theequity method beginning August 1, 2021.\\nOur investments in equity affiliates at December 31, 2022\\nprimarily included our interests in DIRECTV and SKYMexico.\\nDIRECTV We account for our investment in DIRECTV\\nunder the equity method of accounting. DIRECTV isconsidered a variable interest entity for accountingpurposes. As DIRECTV is jointly governed by a board withrepresentation from both AT&T and TPG, with TPG havingtie-breaking authority on certain key decisions, mostsignificantly the appointment and removal of the CEO, wehave concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary ofDIRECTV.The ownership interests in DIRECTV, based on seniority\\nare as follows:\\n• Preferred units with distribution rights of $1,800 held\\nby TPG, which were fully distributed in 2021.\\n• Junior preferred units with distribution rights of\\n$4,250 held by AT&T, of which $702 of distributionrights remain as of December 31, 2022.\\n• Distribution preference associated with Common\\nunits of $4,200 held by AT&T.\\n• Common units, with 70% held by AT&T and 30% held\\nby TPG.\\nThe initial fair value of the equity considerations on July 31,\\n2021 was $6,852, which was determined using adiscounted cash flow model reflecting distribution rightsand preference of the individual instruments. During 2022and 2021, we recognized $1,808 and $619 of equity in netincome of affiliates and received total distributions of$4,457 and $1,942, respectively, from DIRECTV.

Level 2 refers to fair valuesestimated using significant other observable inputs andLevel 3 includes fair values estimated using significantunobservable inputs.\\nThe level of an asset or liability within the fair value\\nhierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that issignificant to the fair value measurement. Our valuationtechniques maximize the use of observable inputs andminimize the use of unobservable inputs.\\nThe valuation methodologies described above may\\nproduce a fair value calculation that may not be indicativeof future net realizable value or reflective of future fairvalues.

Asubstantial portion of the fair values of our investmentsecurities is estimated based on quoted market prices.Investments in equity securities not traded on a nationalsecurities exchange are valued at cost, less anyimpairment, and adjusted for changes resulting fromobservable, orderly transactions for identical or similarsecurities. Investments in debt securities not traded on anational securities exchange are valued using pricingmodels, quoted prices of securities with similarcharacteristics or discounted cash flows.\\nThe components comprising total gains and losses in the\\nperiod on equity securities are as follows:\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\\nTotal gains (losses) recognized\\non equity securities $ (309) $ 293 $ 171\\nGains (Losses) recognized\\non equity securities sold (80) (5) (25)\\nUnrealized gains (losses)\\nrecognized on equity securitiesheld at end of period $ (229) $ 298 $ 196\\nAt December 31, 2022, available-for-sale debt securities\\ntotaling $1,132 have maturities as follows - less than oneyear: $38; one to three years: $158; three to five years:$170; five or more years: $766.\\nOur cash equivalents (money market securities), short-\\nterm investments (certificate and time deposits) andnonrefundable customer deposits are recorded atamortized cost, and the respective carrying amountsapproximate fair values. Short-term investments andnonrefundable customer deposits are recorded in“Prepaid and other current assets” and our investmentsecurities are recorded in “Other Assets” on theconsolidated balance sheets.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nWe enter into derivative transactions to manage certain\\nmarket risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreigncurrency exchange risk. This includes the use of interestrate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forwardcontracts and combined interest rate foreign exchangecontracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not usederivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recordderivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fairvalue that is derived from observable market data,including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all ofour derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated withderivative instruments are presented in the samecategory on the consolidated statements of cash flows asthe item being hedged.Fair Value Hedging Periodically, we enter into and\\ndesignate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fairvalue hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manageinterest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate andfloating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt offixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate paymentsover the life of the swaps without exchange of theunderlying principal amount.\\nWe also designate most of our cross-currency swaps and\\nforeign exchange contracts as fair value hedges. Thepurpose of these contracts is to hedge foreign currencyrisk associated with changes in spot rates on foreigndenominated debt. For cross-currency hedges, we haveelected to exclude the change in fair value of the swaprelated to both time value and cross-currency basisspread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Forforeign exchange contracts, we have elected to excludethe change in fair value of forward points from theassessment of hedge effectiveness.\\nUnrealized and realized gains or losses from fair value\\nhedges impact the same category on the consolidatedstatements of income as the item being hedged, includingthe earnings impact of excluded components. In instanceswhere we have elected to exclude components from theassessment of hedge effectiveness related to fair valuehedges, unrealized gains or losses on such excludedcomponents are recorded as a component ofaccumulated OCI and recognized into earnings over thelife of the hedging instrument. Unrealized gains onderivatives designated as fair value hedges are recordedat fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recordedat fair market value as liabilities. Except for excludedcomponents, changes in the fair value of derivativeinstruments designated as fair value hedges are offsetagainst the change in fair value of the hedged assets orliabilities through earnings. In the years endedDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, no ineffectiveness wasmeasured on fair value hedges.\\nCash Flow Hedging We designated some of our cross-\\ncurrency swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge ourexposure to variability in expected future cash flows thatare attributable to foreign currency risk generated fromour foreign-denominated debt. These agreements includeinitial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreigncurrency denominated amounts to fixed U.S. dollardenominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specifiedrate that is usually determined by the market spot rateupon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of afixed or floating foreign currency-denominated interestrate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate.\\nOn September 30, 2022, we de-designated most of our\\ncross-currency swaps from cash flow hedges and re-designated these swaps as fair value hedges.

Wedetermined our discount rate based on a range of factors,including a yield curve composed of the rates of return onseveral hundred high-quality, fixed income corporatebonds available at the measurement date andcorresponding to the related expected durations of futurecash outflows. These bonds had an average rating of atleast Aa3 or AA- by the nationally recognized statisticalrating organizations, denominated in U.S. dollars, andgenerally not callable, convertible or index linked. For theyear ended December 31, 2022, when compared to theyear ended December 31, 2021, we increased our pensiondiscount rate by 2.20%, resulting in a decrease in ourpension plan benefit obligation of $11,738 and increasedour postretirement discount rate by 2.40%, resulting in adecrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of$2,102. For the year ended December 31, 2021, weincreased our pension discount rate by 0.30%, resulting ina decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of $1,645and increased our postretirement discount rate by 0.40%,resulting in a decrease in our postretirement benefitobligation of $341.\\nWe utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of\\nthe service and interest components of net periodicbenefit costs for pension and other postretirementbenefits. Under this approach, we apply discounting usingindividual spot rates from a yield curve composed of therates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixedincome corporate bonds available at the measurementdate. These spot rates align to each of the projectedbenefit obligations and service cost cash flows. Theservice cost component relates to the active participantsin the plan, so the relevant cash flows on which to applythe yield curve are considerably longer in duration onaverage than the total projected benefit obligation cashflows, which also include benefit payments to retirees.Interest cost is computed by multiplying each spot rate bythe corresponding discounted projected benefitobligation cash flows. The full yield curve approachreduces any actuarial gains and losses based uponinterest rate expectations (e.g., built-in gains in interestcost in an upward sloping yield curve scenario), or gainsand losses merely resulting from the timing andmagnitude of cash outflows associated with our benefitobligations. Neither the annual measurement of our totalbenefit obligations nor annual net benefit cost is affected\\nby the full yield curve approach.\\nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return In 2023, our expected\\nlong-term rate of return is 7.50% on pension plan assetsand 6.50% on postretirement plan assets, an increase of0.75% for pension plan assets and 2.00% forpostretirement plan assets. This update to our assetreturn assumptions was due to economic forecasts andchanges in the asset mix. Our long-term rates of returnreflect the average rate of earnings expected on thefunds invested, or to be invested, to provide for thebenefits included in the projected benefit obligations. Insetting the long-term assumed rate of return,management considers capital markets’ futureexpectations, the asset mix of the plans’ investment andaverage historical asset return. Actual long-term returnscan, in relatively stable markets, also serve as a factor indetermining future expectations. We consider manyfactors that include, but are not limited to, historicalreturns on plan assets, current market information onlong-term returns (e.g., long-term bond rates) and current\\nand target asset allocations between asset categories.\\nThe target asset allocation is determined based onconsultations with external investment advisers. If allother factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a\\n0.50% decrease in the expected long-term rate of returnwould cause 2023 combined pension and postretirementcost to increase $201. However, any differences in the rateand actual returns will be included with the actuarial gain\\nor loss recorded in the fourth quarter when our plans areremeasured.\\nComposite Rate of Compensation Increase Our expected\\ncomposite rate of compensation increase cost of 3.00% in2022 and 2021 reflects the long-term average rate ofsalary increases.\\nHealthcare Cost Trend Our healthcare cost trend\\nassumptions are developed based on historical cost data,the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Based on our assessment of expectations ofhealthcare industry inflation, our 2023 assumed annualhealthcare prescription drug cost trend and medical costtrend for eligible participants will increase from an annualand ultimate trend rate of 4.25% to an annual andultimate trend rate of 4.50%.

FIRSTNET\\nIn 2017, the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet)\\nselected AT&T to build and manage the first nationwidebroadband network dedicated to America’s firstresponders. Under the 25-year agreement, FirstNetprovides 20 MHz of valuable telecommunicationsspectrum and success-based payments of $6,500 over thefirst five years to support network buildout. We arerequired to construct a network that achieves coverage\\n?,',\n",
       "  'and nationwide interoperability requirements and have a\\ncontractual commitment to make sustainability paymentsof $18,000 over the 25-year contract. These sustainabilitypayments represent our commitment to fund FirstNet’soperating expenses and future reinvestments in thenetwork which we own and operate, which we estimate inthe $3,000 or less range over the life of the 25-yearcontract. After FirstNet’s operating expenses are paid, weanticipate the remaining amount, expected to be in the$15,000 range, will be reinvested into the network.\\nDuring 2022, we submitted $195 in sustainability\\npayments, with future payments under the agreement of$195 for 2023, 2024 and 2025; $1,590 for 2026, $1,665 for2027; and $13,365 thereafter. Amounts paid to FirstNet,which are not expected to be returned to AT&T to bereinvested into our network, will be expensed in theperiod paid. In the event FirstNet does not reinvest anyfunds to construct, operate, improve and maintain thisnetwork, our maximum exposure to loss is the totalamount of the sustainability payments, which would bereflected in higher expense.\\nThe $6,500 of initial funding from FirstNet is contingent on\\nthe achievement of six operating capability milestonesand certain first responder subscriber adoption targets.These milestones are based on coverage objectives of thefirst responder network during the construction period,which is expected to be over five years, and subscriberadoption targets. Funding payments received fromFirstNet are reflected as a reduction from the costs\\ncapitalized in the construction of the network and, asappropriate, a reduction of associated operatingexpenses. As of December 31, 2022, we have collectedapproximately $6,120 for the completion of certain tasksand anticipate collecting nearly all of the remainder of the$6,500 as we fulfill contractual deliveries set out byFirstNet in 2023.\\nNOTE 21.

In evaluating these matters on anongoing basis, we take into account amounts alreadyaccrued on the balance sheet.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of materialmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond tothose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in thefinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates madeby management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Additionally, at December 31, 2022, the Company’s postretirement benefitobligation was $7,280 million and exceeded the fair value of postretirement plan assets of $2,160million, resulting in an unfunded benefit obligation of $5,120 million. As explained in Note 14 to theconsolidated financial statements, the Company updates the assumptions used to measure the definedbenefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations, including discount rates, at December 31 orupon a remeasurement event. The Company determines the discount rates used to measure theobligations based on the development of a yield curve using high-quality corporate bonds selected toyield cash flows that correspond to the expected timing and amount of the expected future benefitpayments.\\nAuditing the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations was complex due to the\\njudgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions made by management, primarily the discount rate,used in the Company’s measurement process. The discount rate has a significant effect on themeasurement of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and auditing thediscount rate was complex because it required an evaluation of the credit quality of the corporatebonds used to develop the discount rate and the correlation of those bonds’ cash inflows to the timingand amount of future expected benefit payments.Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\n!\\t',\n",

For example, we evaluated the selected yield curve used to determine the discount ratesapplied in measuring the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations. As part of thisassessment, we considered the credit quality of the corporate bonds that comprised the yield curveand compared the timing and amount of cash flows at maturity with the expected amounts andduration of the related benefit payments.\\nEvaluation of goodwill for impairment\\nDescription of\\nthe MatterAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s goodwill balance was $67,895 million. As discussed in Note 1 to\\nthe consolidated financial statements, reporting unit goodwill is tested at least annually forimpairment. Estimating fair values in connection with these impairment evaluations involves theutilization of discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches. As described in Note 9 to theconsolidated financial statements, impairment charges of $13,478 million in the Business Wirelinereporting unit, $10,508 million in the Consumer Wireline reporting unit and $826 million in the Mexicoreporting unit were recorded during the year.\\nAuditing management’s annual goodwill impairment test for the Consumer Wireline and Business\\nWireline reporting units was complex because the estimation of fair values involves subjectivemanagement assumptions, such as projected terminal growth rates, projected long-term EBITDAmargins, and weighted average cost of capital, and complex valuation methodologies, such as thediscounted cash flow and market multiple approaches. Assumptions used in these valuation models areforward-looking, and changes in these assumptions can have a material effect on the determination offair value.\\nHow We\\nAddressed theMatter in OurAuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain\\ncontrols over the Company’s impairment evaluation processes. Our procedures included testingcontrols over management’s review of the valuation models and its determination of the significantassum\\nptions described above.\\nOur audit procedures to test management’s impairment evaluations included, among others, assessing\\nthe valuation methodologies and significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying dataused to develop such assumptions. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to currentindustry, market and economic trends, and other guideline companies in the same industry. Whereappropriate, we evaluated whether changes to the Company’s business and other factors would affectthe significant assumptions. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates andperformed independent sensitivity analyses. We involved our valuation specialists to assist us inevaluating the methodologies and auditing the assumptions used to calculate the estimated fair valuesof the Company’s reporting units.\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999.\\nDallas, Texas\\nFebruary 13, 2023Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (continued)\\n! \\n',\n",

Management expects wireless customer additions will \\ndecline in 2023 as industry growth slows from the torrid pace of the past couple years, which will benefit cash \\nflow, but the firm also signaled that it will work to continue gaining share. We are maintaining our $25 fair value \\nestimate and think the stock remains modestly undervalued.\\n \\nAT&T added 656,000 postpaid phone customers during the fourth quarter, down from 884,000 a year ago and \\nplacing it between T-Mobile (927,000 net additions) and Verizon (217,000). The rate of customer defections \\n(churn) was flat versus the prior quarter, bucking the usual seasonal uptick as the impact of price increases taken \\nover the summer appears to have run its course. On the weak side, however, the firm’s share of new customer \\ndecisions (gross customer additions) dipped during the quarter. Of the big three carriers, only AT&T attracted \\nfewer gross additions than in the prior quarter.\\n \\nWireless service revenue increased 5.2% versus the prior year during the quarter. AT&T’s postpaid phone \\ncustomer base has grown 3.5% over the past year and revenue per customer was 2.5% higher. The slowdown in \\ncustomer additions and a slower customer upgrade pace pulled equipment revenue lower but provided a lift to \\nprofitability. The wireless segment EBITDA margin increased nearly 3 percentage points versus a year ago to \\n38%.\\nFinancial Summary and Key Statistics \\nActual Forecast\\n2021 2022 2023 2024\\nRevenue (USD Mil) 118,208 120,741 121,939 124,557\\nRevenue Growth % 4.4 2.1 1.0 2.2\\nOperating Income (Mil) 22,116 22,911 25,381 26,565\\nOperating Margin % 18.7 19.0 20.8 21.3\\nAdjusted EBITDA (Mil) 39,849 13,434 42,956 44,640\\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin % 33.7 11.1 35.2 35.8\\nEarnings Per Share (Diluted) (USD) 3.01 -1.15 2.59 2.63\\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share (Diluted) (USD) 3.01 2.41 2.87 2.95\\nAdjusted EPS Growth % 91.5 -19.8 18.8 2.8\\nPrice/Earnings 6.2 7.6 7.1 6.9\\nPrice/Book 1.8 1.4 1.4 1.2\\nEV/EBITDA 9.4 26.5 6.9 6.6\\nFree Cash Flow Yield % 12.4 9.2 10.7 12.2\\nSource: Morningstar Valuation Model.

AT&T expects to generate $16 billion of free cash flow in 2023 while it continues to \\ninvest aggressively in its network but with slower customer growth easing working capital needs.\\nConsumer fixed-line revenue increased 2.2% year over year with broadband sales up 6.4%. Broadband net \\ncustomer losses were modestly disappointing at 64,000, up from 20,000 a year ago despite continued expansion \\nof the fiber footprint. We expect AT&T to add net broadband customers in 2023 as a growing portion of \\ncustomers are on the fiber network. Broadband pricing remains solid, as average revenue per fiber customer \\nincreased 9% versus a year ago to nearly $65 per month. EBITDA margins in this segment also continue to \\nexpand nicely, hitting 37% during the quarter, up from 31% a year ago.\\n \\nManagement dialed back fiber network expansion plans somewhat, claiming it will build to around 2.0 million-\\n2.5 million new customer locations annually through 2025, down from 3.5 million-4.0 million targeted previously \\nand around 3 million built in 2022. The firm still plans to reach 30 million customer locations, though this figure \\nincludes both homes and businesses. AT&T is excited about its venture with BlackRock to build fiber networks \\noutside of the traditional AT&T footprint and the prospects for winning government subsidies to build in rural \\nareas, stating that it will invest capital in whichever format proves the most profitable. We agree that the firm \\nshould explore all options on the table, but we aren’t clear yet why management is slowing the pace of the core \\nnetwork buildout.\\nBusiness Strategy & Outlook  Michael Hodel, Director, 25 Jan 2023\\nWe believe AT&T's strategy to invest heavily in its networks makes sense and will serve investors well over the \\nlong term. Aggressively extending fiber and 5G coverage to more locations builds on its core assets—its existing \\nnetwork and customer relationships—and should allow AT&T to gradually expand its share of telecom spending. \\nAT&T is the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, but we believe it has adequate scale, spectrum, \\nand financial resources relative to both Verizon and T-Mobile to generate solid profitability. Also, we believe the \\nindustry’s structure has improved in recent years, with three major players that have little incentive to price \\nirrationally in search of short-term market share gains. We expect the industry will gradually reach competitive \\nbalance as each carrier deploys 5G technology on deep midband spectrum holdings and crafts pricing strategies \\nthat appeal to each market segment.\\nUpstart Dish Network could present challenges in some areas, but we don’t believe it presents a credible threat \\nto the traditional wireless business. Also, AT&T and Dish have a wholesale relationship that should allow AT&T to \\nparticipate in Dish's growth. We expect Dish will focus on emerging wireless applications in the enterprise \\nmarket, an area where AT&T also has a strong presence.\\nAT&T also benefits from its ownership of deep network infrastructure across much of the U.S. and its ability to \\nprovide a range of telecom services. The firm plans to extend fiber to 30 million homes and businesses by the end Sector Industry\\ni Communication \\nServicesTelecom Services\\nBusiness Description\\nThe wireless business contributes about two \\nthirds of AT&T’s revenue following the \\nspinoff of WarnerMedia. The firm is the \\nthird-largest U.S. wireless carrier, connecting \\n69 million postpaid and 18 million prepaid \\nphone customers. Fixed-line enterprise \\nservices, which account for about 20% of \\nrevenue, include internet access, private \\nnetworking, security, voice, and wholesale \\nnetwork capacity. Residential fixed-line \\nservices, about 10% of revenue, primarily \\nconsist of broadband internet access service. \\nAT&T also has a sizable presence in Mexico, \\nserving 21 million customers, but this \\nbusiness only accounts for 2% of revenue. \\nThe firm still holds a 70% equity stake in \\nsatellite television provider DirecTV but does \\nnot consolidate this business in its financial \\nstatements.\",\n",

These \\nefforts should allow the company to serve these locations extremely well while also enhancing wireless coverage \\nin the surrounding areas. If the firm hits its targets, it would be the third-largest high-quality fixed-line network in \\nthe U.S. (behind Comcast and Charter) and the only of the three to also own a nationwide wireless network. We \\nexpect AT&T will have the ability to use its combined wireless and fixed-line capabilities to grab market share in \\nthis large and growing territory over the next decade.\\nBulls Say  Michael Hodel, Director, 26 Jan 2023\\nuFollowing a period of investment, AT&T will hold a nationwide 5G wireless network with deep spectrum behind it \\nand a fiber network capable of reaching nearly one fourth of the U.S.\\nuAT&T has the scale to remain a strong wireless competitor over the long term. With three dominant carriers, \\nindustry pricing should be more rational going forward.\\nuCombining wireless and fixed-line networks with new technologies and deep expertise makes AT&T a force in \\nenterprise services. \\nBears Say  Michael Hodel, Director, 26 Jan 2023\\nuThe cost of maintaining dominance in the wireless industry by controlling spectrum has been exceptionally high \\nover the years. AT&T has spent $40 billion over the past three years for licenses with few prospects for \\nincremental revenue.\\nuAdvancing technology will eventually swamp AT&T’s wireless business, enabling a host of firms to enter the \\nmarket, further commoditizing this service.\\nuAT&T’s massive debt load will catch up with it. Even after spinning off Warner with a huge amount of debt, AT&T \\ncarries far higher leverage than it has historically and its dividend payout remains high. \\nFair Value and Profit Drivers  Michael Hodel, Director, 26 Jan 2023\\nOur $25 fair value estimate assumes that AT&T will deliver modest revenue growth and gradually expanding \\nmargins over the next several years as its wireless and fiber network investments pay off. Our fair value estimate \\nimplies an enterprise value of 8.0 times our 2023 EBITDA estimate and an 8% free cash flow yield. \\nIn wireless, we expect AT&T will slowly gain market share as it re-establishes its market position. We believe \\npostpaid revenue per phone customer will grow modestly amid a relatively stable competitive environment, \\nhitting $60 per month in 2027 versus $55 in 2022. We estimate AT&T generates around $1 billion in revenue \\nannually from connected devices, such as cars. We model this revenue roughly doubling over the next five years \\nas things like edge computing gain adoption, but this estimate is highly uncertain. In total, we expect wireless \\nservice revenue will increase 3%-4% annually on average through 2027, with wireless EBITDA margins holding in \\nthe low-40% range, as cost efficiency efforts and benefits from slower customer growth offset rising network \\noperating costs. \\nWe expect the consumer broadband business will deliver steadily improving growth as the fiber network build \\nout matures. We believe this business has an opportunity to sharply increase margins over the next five years as ',\n",

We model a 39% segment EBITDA \\nmargin in 2027, but this could prove conservative if legacy costs decline precipitously, especially given the \\nabsence of television content costs. Cable rivals that don’t have sizable television revenue, like Cable One, can \\ngenerate EBITDA margins above 50%. \\nWe expect the enterprise services business will gradually return to growth in the coming years with profitability \\nholding steady as cost-cutting balances the loss of higher-margin legacy services. AT&T hasn’t provided much \\ndetail surrounding the enterprise business, making it more difficult to forecast future results. The firm has said \\npreviously that EBITDA in this segment will likely decline steadily until sometime in 2024. We suspect a large \\nportion of the enterprise business will look similar to the consumer fixed-line business over the longer term, \\nprimarily providing basic connectivity and earning attractive margins. That said, AT&T should benefit as fixed-line \\nand wireless services converge, providing opportunities to create, deliver, and manage more complex offerings. \\nIn total, we believe consolidated revenue can grow 2-3% annually over the next five years. We expect capital \\nspending will roughly match management’s current plan in 2023 (around $24 billion, including vendor financing \\npayments) to support the fiber network upgrade and 5G deployment. The firm expects capital spending will \\ndecline sharply beyond 2023 but hasn’t provided a budget, likely to maintain flexibility to pursue growth \\nopportunities. We expect wireless network spending will decline in 2024 and beyond but that the firm will \\ncontinue investing heavily in fiber, holding total capital spending around $22 billion annually through 2027. \\nEconomic Moat  Michael Hodel, Director, 25 Jan 2023\\nWireless is AT&T's most important business. Returns on capital in wireless have eroded somewhat in recent years \\nas the firm has spent heavily on wireless spectrum and invested to put that spectrum to use. We estimate the \\nwireless business produced a return on capital in 2022 of roughly 8%, or about 10% excluding goodwill, modestly \\nabove our estimate of the firm’s cost of capital. These figures are down from about 10% and 12% in 2018. Over \\nthose four years, segment operating income is up 13% cumulatively while the invested capital base has \\nexpanded about 30%, primarily on $40 billion of spectrum purchases. \\nWe expect that wireless returns will remain ahead of AT&T’s cost of capital. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile \\ndominate the U.S. wireless market, collectively claiming nearly 90% of retail postpaid and prepaid phone \\ncustomers between them and supplying the network capacity to support most other players. Providing solid \\nnationwide coverage requires heavy fixed investments in wireless spectrum and network infrastructure. While a \\nlarger customer base does require incremental investment in network capacity, a significant portion of costs are \\neither fixed or more efficiently absorbed as network utilization reaches optimal levels in more locations. \\nThe benefits of fixed-cost leverage and the difficulty of providing a differentiated wireless offering create an \\nefficient scale advantage in the wireless industry. The massive consolidation across the industry over the past 15 \\nyears and the inability of several interested parties, including Dish Network and Comcast, to enter the market \\nusing their own networks provide evidence of efficient scale. Comcast relies on Verizon to support its wireless \\nefforts while Dish will use both the AT&T and T-Mobile networks for several years as it attempts to build a \",\n",

We also expect the high cost of \\nmaintaining nationwide coverage and its diminutive size will limit Dish’s ability to compete on a large scale in the \\ntraditional wireless business over the long term. Each of the three major carriers has pledged substantial capital \\nreturns to shareholders: AT&T’s new dividend totals $8 billion annually and Verizon’s nearly $11 billion, while T-\\nMobile has said it can repurchase up to $60 billion of its shares through 2025. To support these returns, each of \\nthe carriers has guided investors to expect modest but steady revenue growth over the next several years. These \\nactions indicate that none of the carriers is looking to radically disrupt the current pricing structure in the industry \\nand that each will increase prices as needed to offset any cost pressures that emerge. \\nThe fixed-line enterprise services segment is AT&T’s next largest. We believe this operation holds a solid \\ncompetitive position in a consolidating market. AT&T is one of only a handful of companies capable of providing \\ncomplex communications services to business customers with geographically diverse needs. We roughly estimate \\nthis segment earns 10%-15% returns on invested capital excluding goodwill (AT&T’s most recent major \\nacquisition in this area was the 2005 purchase of the legacy AT&T long-distance business). Business services \\nrevenue has steadily declined in recent years, falling to less than $23 billion in 2022 from $29 billion five years \\nearlier. Margins in this segment have held steady, but profits have also declined (EBITDA was less than $9 billion \\n2022 versus $11 billion in 2017). A significant but undisclosed amount of legacy business remains and will \\ncontinue to exert pressure on growth over the next several years, but AT&T has begun to focus its efforts on core \\nnetwork connectivity and services where its assets allow it to deliver unique solutions. Management expects the \\nsegment will near stability in 2023 with growth returning thereafter. \\nAT&T’s last significant business, consumer fixed-line services, doesn’t possess a moat, in our view. We estimate \\nAT&T’s consumer fixed-line networks reach around 55 million homes, or a bit less than half of the U.S. \\npopulation. This business is challenged competitively across most of this footprint thanks to inferior networks \\nrelative to cable competitors. About 25% of the homes in this service territory subscribe to AT&T’s internet access \\nservice, around half the penetration level Comcast claims. The gap between AT&T and its cable rivals has steadily \\nwidened over the past several years. Customer penetration is critical to driving profitability in the telecom \\nbusiness and AT&T’s modest level has left returns on capital around 5%, by our estimate. \\nAT&T has upgraded about one third of its residential footprint to a fiber-to-the-premises network, which provides \\na much stronger competitive position versus cable. The firm plans to expand the FTTP network aggressively over \\nthe next few years, but it has a long way to go on this effort. We expect price competition will remain rational as \\nAT&T’s fiber network grows, as neither AT&T or the cable companies are likely to risk earning less revenue across \\ntheir existing customer bases over the long term to gain share. \\nThe remainder of AT&T’s business includes the Mexican wireless business. We don’t believe the Mexican \\nbusiness has a moat, operating at a fraction of the scale of market leader America Movil. We wouldn’t be ',\n",

In other markets around the world, similarly sized competitors typically enjoy \\nbenign competitive environments. Gaining meaningful market share can take months or years of aggressive \\npricing, given how contracts are typically structured, allowing rivals to easily retaliate. Also, we don’t believe Dish \\nNetwork will disrupt the traditional wireless business. The firm has entered the prepaid market, acquiring the \\nSprint prepaid business. However, Dish holds extremely small market share. With a shaky financial position and a \\nnetwork likely better suited to narrow use cases, we don’t believe the firm will make a broad push into the \\ntraditional wireless market.\\nIn the consumer broadband segment, AT&T has steadily lost wallet share across most of the areas it serves, \\nmaking it increasingly difficult to justify the aggressive network spending needed to keep pace with cable rivals \\non a stand-alone basis. However, we think the segment will enjoy significant synergies with the wireless \\nbusiness as 5G technologies are deployed. We like AT&T’s plan to expand its fiber network in residential areas for \\nthis reason. The transition from the legacy copper network to fiber holds the promise to markedly improve AT&T’s \\ncost structure and overall competitive position but not without significant uncertainty. AT&T plans to overlay \\nabout half its footprint with fiber by 2025. Keeping this effort on budget could be challenging given rising labor \\ncosts and potential zoning challenges. The firm also hopes to essentially abandon another 25% of its fixed-line \\nfootprint, offering only wireless in these areas. Getting these plans past regulators and lawmakers could prove \\ndifficult. \\nIn the fixed-line business services segment, AT&T’s position has strengthened in recent years thanks to \\nconsolidation, which has reduced the number of firms capable of delivering complex services to geographically \\ndiverse customers. The cable companies are expanding their capabilities in this market, but we expect these \\nfirms will need many years to replicate the local and global infrastructure needed to serve larger businesses well \\nwhile also earning healthy margins. More importantly, we don’t have good insight in the revenue mix within AT&\\nT business services segment. While the firm is well positioned to offer core network connectivity and network \\nmanagement services, technological advances have rendered several major business lines, including legacy voice \\nservice, obsolete.\\nRisk and Uncertainty  Michael Hodel, Director, 30 Sep 2022\\nWe have changed our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Medium from High to better reflect the volatility we \\nexpect AT&T investors will face relative to our global coverage. Regulation and technological change are the \\nprimary uncertainties facing AT&T. Wireless and broadband services are often considered necessary for social \\ninclusion, in terms of employment and education.

It could be compelled to invest more in rural markets even if economic returns are \\ninsufficient. \\nRegulators also control the flow of wireless spectrum into the industry, which has created scarcity in the past, \\npushing carriers to pay high prices for licenses. We also suspect when large spectrum blocks are made available, \\nsuch as the 2021 C-band auction, the carriers have felt compelled to bid excessively to keep potential entrants \\nout of the market, especially the cable companies. Regulators around the world have also used spectrum policies \\nto foster additional competition, a strategy the U.S. could follow. \\nOn the technology front, wireless standards continue to evolve, putting more spectrum to use more efficiently. \\nThe cost to deploy wireless networks could come down to the point where numerous new firms are able to enter \\nthe market. The cable companies are already making attempts to leverage their existing networks to provide \\nlimited wireless coverage. Technology could quickly enhance these efforts. While unlikely, in our view, wireless \\ntechnology could also remove the need for AT&T’s fixed-line networks, killing returns on its fiber investments.\\nFinancial Strength  Michael Hodel, Director, 26 Jan 2023\\nThe WarnerMedia spinoff took around $35 billion of debt with it, while a $9 billion spectrum purchase in early \\n2022 offset a portion of this benefit. Net debt stood at $132 billion at the end of 2022, leaving net leverage at \\nabout 3.2 times EBITDA. This load is far higher than the firm has operated under in the past: Immediately before \\nits current capital deployment binge began in 2012 (with a round of heavy share repurchases), AT&T typically \\ncarried leverage of around 1.5 times EBITDA. Fortunately, the current debt load still compares reasonably well \\nwith Verizon and T-Mobile, which both carry similar leverage metrics. \\nThe firm also used the Warner spinoff to adjust its dividend policy, targeting a payout of around 40% of free cash \\nflow, down from more than 70% in 2021 (by our calculation). The new payout totals about $8 billion annually, \\ndown from $15 billion in 2021. The firm has fallen short of management’s cash flow targets over the past year, \\nand it now expects to generate $16 billion of free cash flow in 2023, down from an initial projection of $20 billion. \\nWe still think the dividend policy makes sense, leaving substantial excess cash to reduce leverage and make \\nnetwork investments, which we believe is important to AT&T’s long-term health. \\nWith the reduced dividend payout leaving sizable excess cash flow, the firm plans to repay debt. Management \\ntargets net leverage of 2.5 times EBITDA, which it now believes it can hit in early 2025, rather than its initial \\nexpectation of late 2023. We believe the revised timeline is achievable, absent any major capital outlays. These \\ntargets also exclude $5.2 billion of preferred shares, around $5 billion of preferred interests in various \\nsubsidiaries, and a perpetual preferred stake in the wireless business held by AT&T’s pension plans that pays \\n$560 million annually. The firm used $2.7 billion to repurchase a portion of these preferred interests in late 2022. \\nCapital Allocation  Michael Hodel, Director, 30 Sep 2022\\nWe believe recent capital allocation decisions have destroyed shareholder value and the firm will pay the price \\nfor these missteps for some time to come.

This assessment stems from our view that a relatively weak balance sheet has hindered AT&T's strategic \\nflexibility and willingness to invest aggressively in the business when needed. The state of the balance sheet is \\nthe result of several ill-considered acquisitions, poorly timed share repurchases, and an insistence on increasing \\nthe dividend even as leverage mounted. Management is moving in the right direction, using the Warner spinoff \\nto shift to a dividend policy that better supports needed investment, but AT&T is still playing catch-up. It will need \\nto invest aggressively for the next several years to make its fixed-line network competitive, and it doesn’t expect \\nto get debt leverage below targeted levels until the end of 2023. With cash flow expectations coming down \\nrecently, we wouldn't be surprised if management pushes its targeted leverage date further out.  \\nThe firm’s run of heavy capital deployment began in 2012 with a massive share-repurchase program that, at the \\ntime, was billed as a temporary move away from AT&T’s 1.5 times net debt/EBITDA leverage target. The firm \\nrepurchased $27 billion of its shares through 2014 at prices per share in the mid-$30s, pushing leverage to 1.8 \\ntimes. The firm then pursued the AWS-3 auction, the DirecTV deal, expansion into Mexico, the Time Warner \\nacquisition, and the recent C-band auction. With leverage nearing 3.2 times EBITDA in early 2021, AT&T’s capital \\nstructure simply didn’t line up well with a large dividend payout. Yet management explicitly expressed support for \\nthe prior dividend until immediately before changing direction, catching long-suffering investors off guard.  \\nThese capital forays not only left AT&T with a weaker balance sheet, they also left the firm in a weaker \\ncompetitive position overall, in our view. With 2015’s DirecTV purchase, AT&T acquired a satellite TV business \\nthat was, at best, peaking in maturity. AT&T has sold a stake in the television business but still has exposure to \\nthis declining business. More importantly, as the firm was shifting its strategy, it didn’t invest as aggressively as \\nit should have in its core business. Until recently, it had prioritized short-term margins over maintaining wireless \\nmarket share, allowing T-Mobile to steadily steal customers. In addition, AT&T has only begrudgingly invested to \\nexpand its fiber optic network in the past. New CEO John Stankey has increased investment to retain customers \\nand has made fiber construction a top priority, which should improve AT&T’s position but will also dent cash flow \\nover at least the next couple of years.  \\nAT&T has placed a priority on debt reduction since the Time Warner merger closed, using asset sales as a part of \\nthis effort. Not all these sales have made strategic sense, in our view. For example, the sale of its wireless assets \\nin Puerto Rico seemed odd, given the territory’s strong ties to the U.S. and AT&T’s presence elsewhere in Latin \\nAmerica. Management has also been less than forthright, in our view, concerning the debt load, using preferred \\nshares, receivables securitization, and vendor financing to cloud its financial picture.  \\nShareholders have suffered because of AT&T’s choices. The stock returned only 2% annually over the 20 years \\nleading up to the Warner spinoff and 3% over the previous decade, as a declining share price has partially offset \\ndividends paid. While the telecom industry hasn’t delivered stellar returns in general, with several firms hitting \\nbankruptcy in recent years, AT&T's shares lagged those of nearly every major U.S. telecom peer over that prior \\ndecade, including Verizon (7% returns annually), Comcast (14%), Charter (23%), and T-Mobile (23%).

We suspect \\nindustry bears hold two key contentions: First, the carriers will perpetually spend egregiously on their networks, \\nprimarily buying wireless spectrum whenever the government makes more available. Second, in an extremely \\nmature market, these firms will beat each other up seeking whatever growth remains, punishing revenue and \\nmargins. As such, balance sheets will continually need repair and cash available for shareholders will be \\nincreasingly limited.We believe this outlook is wrong. Following a series of spectrum auctions, AT&T and Verizon \\nhave acquired a trove of spectrum that should allow both firms to close the network speed and capacity gap that \\nT-Mobile has opened recently. Even with the huge increase in capital invested following these auctions, returns \\non capital remain acceptable for each of the wireless carriers, in our view. Going forward, we expect driving \\nreturns comfortably above the cost of capital will be the carriers' highest priority.Market share shifts gradually \\nthanks to phone installment plans and general customer inertia. As a result, we believe the carriers will have \\nincreasingly little to gain from huge new network initiatives or increased promotional intensity designed to grab \\nmarket share. Maximizing the long-term value of the industry as whole, without running afoul of regulators, is the \\nrational choice for each carrier in our view.In our view, this outlook means that market share will gradually move \\ntoward parity. As the current share leader and historically the industry's premium player, we believe Verizon has \\nlittle choice but to accept gradual market share losses. The stock market clearly hates the customer losses the \\nfirm has reported recently. However, we account for share losses in our fair value estimate. While AT&T and T-\\nMobile also trade below our fair value estimates, we believe Verizon shares are particularly attractive. \\nAT&T Posts Another Solid Quarter as Revenue Growth Continues to Accelerate  Michael Hodel,Director,20 Oct \\n2022\\nAT&T’s third-quarter results lend support to our view that the firm is poised to deliver steadily improving \\nperformance in the coming years. While wireless customer additions slowed, revenue per customer spiked \\nhigher, exceeding our expectations. The firm expects to meet or exceed financial targets for the year, including \\ngenerating $14 billion of free cash flow. While AT&T has clearly backed away from the 2023 free cash flow target \\nof $20 billion set following the Warner spinoff, management expects this metric to grow next year, which we \\nbelieve to be very reasonable and provides comfort around the dividend. We are maintaining our $25 fair value \\nestimate, and we think the stock is significantly undervalued.Adjusted for business dispositions, total revenue \\nincreased 3.1% year over year on solid results across all segments. Wireless service revenue (about half of total \\nfirm sales) increased 5.6%, the best result in a decade. AT&T added 708,000 postpaid phone customers during \\nthe quarter, down from 928,000 a year ago. The firm continues to do a great job of attracting new customers but \\nthe pace of those leaving picked up slightly: monthly postpaid phone churn was 0.84%, up from 0.72% last year. \",\n",

Also, average revenue per postpaid phone customer jumped 2.4% versus a year ago, far stronger than \\nexpected entering the year given the accelerating amortization of past promotional credits against \\nrevenue.Wireless profitability remains solid.

The continued growth in wireless additions led to an \\nincrease in the mobility services revenue growth target to 4%-5% from “at least 3%.” However, management cut \\nits free cash flow target for 2022 by $2 billion to $14 billion due to continued growth investments and the timing \\nof collections. Our fair value estimate, which reflects the Warner spinoff, remains $25 per share. We continue to \\nlike AT&T’s strategic position and its network investment plans, which we expect will deliver improving revenue \\nand profit growth over the next several years.Adjusted for the Warner spinoff, DirecTV transaction, and Latin \\nAmerican asset sale, total revenue (now roughly two thirds wireless, with most of the remainder enterprise and \\nconsumer fixed-line services) increased 2.2% year over year to $29.6 billion. Wireless service revenue growth \\naccelerated to 4.8% year over year, ahead of management’s previous 2022 target and in line with the new one, \\non strong postpaid phone customer growth in recent quarters. AT&T added 813,000 postpaid phone customers \\nduring the quarter, up from 798,000 a year ago, the strongest second quarter in a decade. Despite more than two \\nyears of blistering industrywide growth, we still believe that postpaid customer additions will eventually have to \\ntick down and match population growth more closely, but AT&T has yet to see any sign of falling \\ndemand.Average revenue per postpaid phone customer was also strong, growing 1.1% versus a year ago as \\npromotional credits, which are amortized against revenue, declined in the quarter and more customers traded up \\nto higher-priced unlimited plans. Management expects average revenue per postpaid phone customer to improve \\nfurther in the second half. Segment EBITDA expanded by 2.5% year over year, with further expansion projected in \\nthe second half of 2022. \\nAT&T Avoids Distraction, Continues to Gain Wireless Momentum During Q1  Michael Hodel,Director,21 Apr \\n2022\\nAT&T delivered generally solid telecom results for its first quarter, putting it on pace to at least meet \\nmanagement’s 2022 growth expectations.

Our fair value estimate, recently adjusted to reflect the Warner spinoff, remains $25 \\nper share. We continue to like AT&T’s strategic position and its network investment plans, which we expect will \\ndeliver improving revenue and profit growth over the next several years.Adjusted for the Warner spinoff, DirecTV \\ntransaction, and Latin American asset sale, total revenue (now roughly two thirds wireless, with most of the \\nremainder enterprise and consumer fixed-line services) increased 2.5% year over year.

That strength continued as AT&T added 691,000 postpaid \\nphone customers during the quarter, up from 595,000 a year ago, extending the impressive turnaround in the \\nbusiness. After two years of torrid industrywide growth, postpaid customer additions will eventually have to \\nmatch population growth more closely, but AT&T hasn’t yet seen any sign of falling demand.Average revenue per \\npostpaid phone customer was also surprisingly strong (though perhaps buoyed by the 3G shutdown), declining \\nonly 0.2% versus a year ago despite heavy promotional credits, which are amortized against revenue. Segment \\nEBITDA declined 1.8% year over year but would have increased about 2% absent 3G network shutdown costs. \\nWarner Bros. Discovery Launches as a Media Powerhouse; AT&T Now Focused on Telecom  Neil \\nMacker,Senior Equity Analyst,11 Apr 2022\\nThe long-awaited merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia is complete. We are maintaining our narrow \\nmoat rating for the successor firm and lowering our fair value estimate to $40 from $42 as we have updated our \\nmodel to fully incorporate the pro forma results and to forecast the combined firm. For AT&T, we also maintain \\nour narrow moat rating on the standalone telecom firm, with a $25 fair value estimate.Warner Bros. Discovery is \\nnow one of the largest media firms in the world with tremendous scale and reach. The merger has created a firm \\nwith tremendous content production and distribution capabilities along with a very deep and wide content \\nlibrary. The new company owns a number of well-known networks including HBO, Discovery, CNN, and TLC as \\nwell as a slew of major entertainment franchises like Superman, Rick and Morty, and Game of Thrones. We \\nproject that the new company, led by Discovery CEO David Zaslav, will use its combined programming library and \\nproduction capabilities to drive further growth in its streaming services as it navigates the transition toward a \\nmore direct-to-consumer focused model, centered on combined HBO Max/Discovery+ services.As for AT&T, we \\nbelieve the firm is in a much stronger place, with renewed management focus and a stronger financial position. \\nWe remain optimistic about the wireless business and expect that AT&T and its rivals will compete rationally, \\nallowing for steady, albeit slow, growth and solid cash flow. We also like the firm’s investment plans, which call \\nfor aggressive investment in wireless network capacity and the fiber network over the next several years. We \\nexpect AT&T will emerge from this period of investment in a unique place within the telecom industry, with the \\nability to use its combined wireless and fixed-line capabilities to grab market share across a large and growing \\nportion of the U.S. ',\n",

AT&T has two major priorities focused on a common objective: deploying the mid-band spectrum \\nacquired recently and expanding its fiber network aggressively to provide high-quality telecom services. \\nManagement reiterated its $20 billion 2023 free cash flow target, clarifying that this figure includes payments for \\nvendor financing.

The firm also spoke at length for the first time about retiring its copper \\nnetworks—it believes current demand is so low across 25% of its fixed-line territory (about 15 million locations) \\nthat regulators will allow it to shift exclusively to wireless technologies in those locations by the end of 2025. If \\nsuccessful, this shift would substantially improve the firm’s cost structure.AT&T also expects to cover 200 million \\npeople with deep mid-band spectrum holdings by the end of 2023, likely putting it behind Verizon (targeting 175 \\nmillion by the end of this year) and T-Mobile (210 million at the end of 2021). We don’t believe this gap is a \\nconcern as AT&T is likely targeting areas with the strongest need, and it should reach coverage parity quickly \\nbeyond 2023. We expect AT&T will have a strong network position over the medium term as it combines fiber and \\nwireless coverage.The $24 billion network budget for 2022 was maintained, but, as with Verizon last week, AT&T \\nmade clear that spending will ramp down once spending to deploy mid-band spectrum slows in 2024. We believe \\nAT&T’s financial targets, including its investment plans, make the same assumption as Verizon’s--that the \\nwireless competitive environment remains the same or improves in the coming years.

Analysts  create  custom  industry  and \\ncompany  assumptions  to feed income  statement,  balance \\nsheet,  and capital  investment  assumptions  into our glob-\\nally standardized,  proprietary  discounted  cash  flow,  or \\nDCF,  modeling  templates.  We use scenario  analysis,  inde-\\npth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other \\nanalytical  tools  to augment  this process.  Moreover,  we \\nthink  analyzing  valuation  through  discounted  cash  flows \\npresents  a better  lens for viewing  cyclical  companies, \\nhigh-growth  firms,  businesses  with  finite  lives  (e.g., \\nmines),  or companies  expected  to generate  negative \\nearnings  over the next few years.  That said,  we don’t  dis-\\nmiss multiples  altogether  but rather  use them  as support-\\ning cross-checks  for our DCF-based  fair value  estimates. \\nWe also acknowledge  that DCF models  offer  their  own \\nchallenges  (including  a potential  proliferation  of estim-\\nated inputs  and the possibility  that the method  may miss \\nshortterm  market-price  movements),  but we believe  these \\nnegatives  are mitigated  by deep  analysis  and our \\nlongterm approach.\\nMorningstar’s  equity  research  group  (”we,”  “our”)  be-\\nlieves  that a company’s  intrinsic  worth  results  from  the \\nfuture cash flows it can generate. The Morningstar Rating \\nfor stocks  identifies  stocks  trading  at a discount  or premi-\\num to their  intrinsic  worth—or  fair value  estimate,  in \\nMorningstar  terminology.  Five-star  stocks  sell for the \\nbiggest  risk adjusted  discount  to their  fair values,  where-\\nas 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.\\nFour key components  drive  the Morningstar  rating:  (1) our \\nassessment  of the firm’s  economic  moat,  (2) our estimate \\nof the stock’s  fair value,  (3) our uncertainty  around  that \\nfair value  estimate  and (4) the current  market  price.  This \\nprocess  ultimately  culminates  in our singlepoint  star rat-\\ning.\\n1. Economic Moat\\nThe concept  of an economic  moat  plays  a vital role not \\nonly in our qualitative  assessment  of a firm’s  long-term \\ninvestment  potential,  but also in the actual  calculation  of \\nour fair value  estimates.  An economic  moat  is a structural \\nfeature  that allows  a firm to sustain  excess  profits  over a long  period  of time.  We define  economic  profits  as re-\\nturns  on invested  capital  (or ROIC)  over and above  our es-\\ntimate  of a firm’s  cost of capital,  or weighted  average \\ncost of capital  (or WACC).  Without  a moat,  profits  are \\nmore  susceptible  to competition.  We have  identified  five \\nsources  of economic  moats:  intangible  assets,  switching \\ncosts, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.\\nCompanies  with a narrow  moat  are those  we believe  are \\nmore  likely  than  not to achieve  normalized  excess  returns \\nfor at least  the next 10 years.  Wide-moat  companies  are \\nthose  in which  we have  very high confidence  that excess \\nreturns  will remain  for 10 years,  with excess  returns  more \\nlikely  than  not to remain  for at least  20 years.  The longer \\na firm generates  economic  profits,  the higher  its intrinsic \\nvalue.  We believe  low-quality,  no-moat  companies  will \\nsee their  normalized  returns  gravitate  toward  the firm’s \\ncost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.\\nWhen  considering  a company's  moat,  we also assess \\nwhether  there  is a substantial  threat  of value  destruction, \\nstemming  from  risks  related  to ESG,  industry  disruption, \\nfinancial  health,  or other  idiosyncratic  issues.  In this con-\\ntext, a risk is considered  potentially  value  destructive  if its \\noccurrence  would  eliminate  a firm’s  economic  profit  on a \\ncumulative  or midcycle  basis.  If we deem  the probability \\nof occurrence  sufficiently  high,  we would  not characterize \\nthe company as possessing an economic moat.\\nTo assess  the sustainability  of excess  profits,  analysts \\nperform  ongoing  assessments  of the moat  trend.  A firm’s \\nmoat  trend  is positive  in cases  where  we think  its sources \\nof competitive  advantage  are growing  stronger;  stable \\nwhere  we don’t  anticipate  changes  to competitive  ad-\\nvantages  over the next several  years;  or negative  when \\nwe see signs of deterioration.\\n2. Estimated Fair Value\\nCombining  our analysts’  financial  forecasts  with  the \\nfirm’s  economic  moat  helps  us assess  how long returns \\non invested  capital  are likely  to exceed  the firm’s  cost of \\ncapital.  Returns  of firms  with a wide  economic  moat  rat-\\ning are assumed  to fade  to the perpetuity  period  over a \\nlonger  period  of time  than  the returns  of narrow-moat \\nfirms,  and both  will fade  slower  than  no-moat  firms,  in-\\ncreasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.Our model is divided into three distinct stages:\\nStage I: Explicit Forecast\\nIn this stage,  which  can last five to 10 years,  analysts \\nmake  full financial  statement  forecasts,  including  items \\nsuch  as revenue,  profit  margins,  tax rates,  changes  in \\nworkingcapital  accounts,  and capital  spending.  Based  on \\nthese  projections,  we calculate  earnings  before  interest, \\nafter  taxes  (EBI)  and the net new investment  (NNI)  to de-\\nrive our annual free cash flow forecast.\\nStage II: Fade\\nThe second  stage  of our model  is the period  it will take \\nthe company’s  return  on new invested  capital—the  re-\\nturn on capital  of the next dollar  invested  (“RONIC”)—to \\ndecline  (or rise) to its cost of capital.  During  the Stage  II \\nperiod,  we use a formula  to approximate  cash  flows  in \\nlieu of explicitly  modeling  the income  statement,  balance \\nsheet,  and cash  flow statement  as we do in Stage  I. The \\nlength  of the second  stage  depends  on the strength  of \\nthe company’s  economic  moat.  We forecast  this period  to \\nlast anywhere  from  one year (for companies  with no eco-\\nnomic  moat)  to 10–15  years  or more  (for wide-moat  com-\\npanies).  During  this period,  cash  flows  are forecast  using \\nfour assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the \\nperiod,  a normalized  investment  rate,  average  return  on \\nnew invested  capital  (RONIC),  and the number  of years \\nuntil  perpetuity,  when  excess  returns  cease.  The invest-\\nment  rate and return  on new invested  capital  decline  un-\\ntil a perpetuity  value  is calculated.  In the case  of firms \\nthat do not earn their  cost of capital,  we assume  marginal \\nROICs  rise to the firm’s  cost of capital  (usually  attribut-\\nable  to less reinvestment),  and we may truncate  the \\nsecond stage.\\nStage III: Perpetuity\\nOnce  a company’s  marginal  ROIC  hits its cost of capital, \\nwe calculate  a continuing  value,  using  a standard  per-\\npetuity  formula.  At perpetuity,  we assume  that any \\ngrowth  or decline  or investment  in the business  neither \\ncreates  nor destroys  value  and that any new investment \\nprovides a return in line with estimated WACC.\\nBecause a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar \\nearned  tomorrow,  we discount  our projections  of cash \\nflows  in stages  I, II, and III to arrive  at a total  present \\nvalue  of expected  future  cash  flows.  Because  we are \\nmodeling  free cash  flow to the firm—representing  cash \\navailable  to provide  a return  to all capital  providers—we \\ndiscount  future  cash  flows  using  the WACC,  which  is a \\nweighted  average  of the costs  of equity,  debt,  and pre-\\nferred  stock  (and  any other  funding  sources),  using  ex-\\npected  future  proportionate  long-term,  market-value \\nweights.\\n3.

This rating  is used  to assign  the margin  of safety \\nrequired  before  investing,  which  in turn explicitly  drives \\nour stock  star rating  system.  The Uncertainty  Rating  is \\naimed  at identifying  the confidence  we should  have  in as-\\nsigning a fair value estimate for a given stock. \\nOur Uncertainty  Rating  is meant  to take into account  any-\\nthing  that can increase  the potential  dispersion  of future \\noutcomes  for the intrinsic  value  of a company,  and any-\\nthing  that can affect  our ability  to accurately  predict \\nthese  outcomes.  The rating  begins  with a suggested  rat-\\ning produced  by a quantitative  process  based  on the trail-\\ning 12-month  standard  deviation  of daily  stock  returns. \\nAn analyst  overlay  is then  applied,  with  analysts  using \\nthe suggested  rating,  historical  rating  data,  and their  own \\nknowledge  of the company  to inform  them  as they make \\nthe final Uncertainty  Rating  decision.  Ultimately,  the rat-\\ning decision  rests  with the analyst.  Analysts  take into ac-\\ncount  many  characteristics  when  making  their  final  de-\\ncision,  including  cyclical  factors,  operational  and financial \\nfactors  such  as leverage,  company-specific  events,  ESG \\nrisks,  and anything  else that might  increase  the potential \\ndispersion  of future  outcomes  and our ability  to estimate \\nthose outcomes. \\nOur recommended  margin  of safety—the  discount  to fair \\nvalue  demanded  before  we’d  recommend  buying  or \\nselling  the stock—widens  as our uncertainty  of the es-\\ntimated  value  of the equity  increases.  The more  uncertain \\nwe are about  the potential  dispersion  of outcomes,  the \\ngreater the discount we require relative to our estimate of \\nthe value  of the firm before  we would  recommend  the \\npurchase  of the shares.  In addition,  the Uncertainty  Rat-\\ning provides  guidance  in portfolio  construction  based  on \\nrisk tolerance. \\nOur Uncertainty  Ratings  are: Low,  Medium,  High,  Very \\nHigh, and Extreme.\\nMargin of Safety\\nQualitative Analysis \\nUncertainty Ratings QQQQQ Rating QRating\\nLow 20% Discount 25% Premium\\nMedium 30% Discount 35% Premium\\nHigh 40% Discount 55% Premium\\nVery High 50% Discount 75% Premium\\nExtreme 75% Discount 300% Premium\\nOur uncertainty  rating  is based  on the interquartile  range, \\nor the middle  50% of potential  outcomes,  covering  the \\n25th percentile–75th  percentile.  This means  that when  a \\nstock  hits 5 stars,  we expect  there  is a 75% chance  that \\nthe intrinsic  value  of that stock  lies above  the current \\nmarket  price.  Similarly,  when  a stock  hits 1 star,  we ex-pect there  is a 75% chance  that the intrinsic  value  of that \\nstock lies below the current market price.\\n4.

In \\nother  words,  ESG Risk Ratings  measures  a company’s  un-\\nmanaged  ESG Risks  represented  as a quantitative  score. \\nUnmanaged  Risk is measured  on an open-ended  scale \\nstarting  at zero (no risk) with  lower  scores  representing \\nless unmanaged  risk and, for 95% of cases,  the unman-\\naged ESG Risk score is below 50.\\nBased  on their  quantitative  scores,  companies  are \\ngrouped  into one of five Risk Categories  (negligible,  low, \\nmedium,  high,  severe).  These  risk categories  are absolute, \\nmeaning  that a ‘high  risk’ assessment  reflects  a compar-\\nable degree  of unmanaged  ESG risk across  all subindus-\\ntries covered.\\nThe ESG Risk Rating  Assessment  is a visual  representa-\\ntion of Sustainalytics  ESG Risk Categories  on a 1 to 5 \\nscale.  Companies  with  Negligible  Risk = 5 Globes,  Low \\nRisk = 4, Medium  Risk = 3 Globes,  High  Risk = 2 Globes, \\nSevere  Risk = 1 Globe.

Ratings  involve  unknown  risks and \\nuncertainties  which  may cause  our expectations  not to \\noccur  or to differ  significantly  from  what  was expected \\nand should  not be considered  an offer  or solicitation  to \\nbuy or sell a security.\\nRisk Warning\\nPlease  note  that investments  in securities  are subject  to \\nmarket  and other  risks and there  is no assurance  or guar-\\nantee  that the intended  investment  objectives  will be \\nachieved.  Past performance  of a security  may or may not \\nbe sustained  in future  and is no indication  of future  per-\\nformance.

These trends have continued into Q2 2023 with April revenue growth rates lower than\\nQ1 2023. We expect revenue growth to improve toward the end of 2023 as optimization efforts of customers are exhausted. AWS’\\ncustomers continue to increase commitments for future capacity usage and we expect strong long-term growth for AWS benefiting\\nfrom migration of IT infrastructure investments from on-premise to the cloud. AWS is also well-positioned to capitalize on the rapidly\\ngrowing AI opportunity in the cloud with its scalable infrastructure, tools for developers to build and deploy models and services that\\ncustomers can use to leverage proprietary large language models. At the same time, AWS faces strong competitors with financial\\nresources such as Microsoft Corporation (Aaa Stable), Oracle Corporation (Baa2 Stable), Alphabet Inc.

Nonetheless, competition has accelerated from larger players such\\nas Walmart Inc. (Aa2 stable), Target Corporation (A2 stable) and Best Buy Co., Inc. (A3 stable), all of which have continued to enhance\\ntheir online capabilities. These larger brick-and-mortar retailers can also leverage their store networks and proprietary distribution\\ncapability to offer the consumer options for obtaining their purchases. In store pickup provides a competitive offering (within hours\\nin most cases) and a more cost effective alternative to the seller. In addition, some brick-and-mortar retailers already have vehicle\\nnetworks that are used to stock its stores which could be used for some same day delivery capability. An example is the auto parts\\nretailers, which measure delivery times in hours, not days.\\nAmazon faces an increasingly competitive environment as the pandemic accelerated investment in areas such as curbside pickup,\\ninventory visibility and better usage of stores to fulfill orders.\",\n",

To offset rising costs, the\\ncompany increased pricing on its prime membership in the U.S. in 2022 from $119 to $139 annually.

AT&T is a holding company whose subsidiariesand affiliates operate worldwide in thetelecommunications and technology industries.\\nOn April 8, 2022, we completed the separation of our\\nWarnerMedia business, which represented substantially allof our WarnerMedia segment, in a Reverse Morris Trusttransaction, under which Magallanes, Inc. (Spinco), aformerly wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T that held theWarnerMedia business, was distributed to AT&Tstockholders via a pro rata dividend, followed by thecombination of Spinco with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc.(Discovery), which was renamed Warner Bros. Discovery,Inc. (WBD). (See Note 6)\\nUpon the separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia\\nbusiness met the criteria for discontinued operations.',\n",
       "  'Fordiscontinued operations, we also evaluated transactionsthat were components of AT&T’s single plan of a strategicshift, including dispositions that previously did notindividually meet the criteria due to materiality, and havedetermined discontinued operations to be comprised ofWarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic).These businesses are reflected in the accompanyingfinancial statements as discontinued operations, includingfor periods prior to the consummation of theWarnerMedia/Discovery transaction. (See Notes 6 and 23)\\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG\\nCapital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTVEntertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close ofthe transaction, we separated and deconsolidated ourVideo business, comprised of our U.S. video operations,and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTVunder the equity method (see Notes 6, 10 and 19).\\nAll significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in\\nthe consolidation process.',\n",
       "  'All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in\\nthe consolidation process. Investments in subsidiaries andpartnerships which we do not control but have significantinfluence are accounted for under the equity method.Earnings from certain investments accounted for usingthe equity method are included in our results on a onequarter lag. We also record our proportionate share of ourequity method investees’ other comprehensive income(OCI) items, including translation adjustments. We treatdistributions received from equity method investees asreturns on investment and classify them as cash flowsfrom operating activities until those distributions exceedour cumulative equity in the earnings of that investment.We treat the excess amount as a return of investment andclassify it as cash flows from investing activities.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity\\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)requires management to make estimates andassumptions, including other estimates of fair value,\\nprobable losses and expenses, that affect the amountsreported in the financial statements and accompanyingnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Moreover, unfavorable changes in market conditions,including interest rates, could adversely impact thoseestimates and result in asset impairments.

Management expects wireless customer additions will \\ndecline in 2023 as industry growth slows from the torrid pace of the past couple years, which will benefit cash \\nflow, but the firm also signaled that it will work to continue gaining share. We are maintaining our $25 fair value \\nestimate and think the stock remains modestly undervalued.\\n \\nAT&T added 656,000 postpaid phone customers during the fourth quarter, down from 884,000 a year ago and \\nplacing it between T-Mobile (927,000 net additions) and Verizon (217,000).',\n",

On the weak side, however, the firm’s share of new customer \\ndecisions (gross customer additions) dipped during the quarter. Of the big three carriers, only AT&T attracted \\nfewer gross additions than in the prior quarter.\\n \\nWireless service revenue increased 5.2% versus the prior year during the quarter. AT&T’s postpaid phone \\ncustomer base has grown 3.5% over the past year and revenue per customer was 2.5% higher.

Broadband net \\ncustomer losses were modestly disappointing at 64,000, up from 20,000 a year ago despite continued expansion \\nof the fiber footprint. We expect AT&T to add net broadband customers in 2023 as a growing portion of \\ncustomers are on the fiber network.

       "  \"The firm still plans to reach 30 million customer locations, though this figure \\nincludes both homes and businesses. AT&T is excited about its venture with BlackRock to build fiber networks \\noutside of the traditional AT&T footprint and the prospects for winning government subsidies to build in rural \\nareas, stating that it will invest capital in whichever format proves the most profitable. We agree that the firm \\nshould explore all options on the table, but we aren’t clear yet why management is slowing the pace of the core \\nnetwork buildout.\\nBusiness Strategy & Outlook  Michael Hodel, Director, 25 Jan 2023\\nWe believe AT&T's strategy to invest heavily in its networks makes sense and will serve investors well over the \\nlong term. Aggressively extending fiber and 5G coverage to more locations builds on its core assets—its existing \\nnetwork and customer relationships—and should allow AT&T to gradually expand its share of telecom spending. \\nAT&T is the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, but we believe it has adequate scale, spectrum, \\nand financial resources relative to both Verizon and T-Mobile to generate solid profitability.\",\n",
       "  \"Also, we believe the \\nindustry’s structure has improved in recent years, with three major players that have little incentive to price \\nirrationally in search of short-term market share gains. We expect the industry will gradually reach competitive \\nbalance as each carrier deploys 5G technology on deep midband spectrum holdings and crafts pricing strategies \\nthat appeal to each market segment.\\nUpstart Dish Network could present challenges in some areas, but we don’t believe it presents a credible threat \\nto the traditional wireless business. Also, AT&T and Dish have a wholesale relationship that should allow AT&T to \\nparticipate in Dish's growth. We expect Dish will focus on emerging wireless applications in the enterprise \\nmarket, an area where AT&T also has a strong presence.\\nAT&T also benefits from its ownership of deep network infrastructure across much of the U.S. and its ability to \\nprovide a range of telecom services. The firm plans to extend fiber to 30 million homes and businesses by the end Sector Industry\\ni Communication \\nServicesTelecom Services\\nBusiness Description\\nThe wireless business contributes about two \\nthirds of AT&T’s revenue following the \\nspinoff of WarnerMedia.

We model this revenue roughly doubling over the next five years \\nas things like edge computing gain adoption, but this estimate is highly uncertain. In total, we expect wireless \\nservice revenue will increase 3%-4% annually on average through 2027, with wireless EBITDA margins holding in \\nthe low-40% range, as cost efficiency efforts and benefits from slower customer growth offset rising network \\noperating costs. \\nWe expect the consumer broadband business will deliver steadily improving growth as the fiber network build \\nout matures.

Cable rivals that don’t have sizable television revenue, like Cable One, can \\ngenerate EBITDA margins above 50%. \\nWe expect the enterprise services business will gradually return to growth in the coming years with profitability \\nholding steady as cost-cutting balances the loss of higher-margin legacy services.

Returns on capital in wireless have eroded somewhat in recent years \\nas the firm has spent heavily on wireless spectrum and invested to put that spectrum to use. We estimate the \\nwireless business produced a return on capital in 2022 of roughly 8%, or about 10% excluding goodwill, modestly \\nabove our estimate of the firm’s cost of capital.

Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile \\ndominate the U.S. wireless market, collectively claiming nearly 90% of retail postpaid and prepaid phone \\ncustomers between them and supplying the network capacity to support most other players. Providing solid \\nnationwide coverage requires heavy fixed investments in wireless spectrum and network infrastructure. While a \\nlarger customer base does require incremental investment in network capacity, a significant portion of costs are \\neither fixed or more efficiently absorbed as network utilization reaches optimal levels in more locations. \\nThe benefits of fixed-cost leverage and the difficulty of providing a differentiated wireless offering create an \\nefficient scale advantage in the wireless industry. The massive consolidation across the industry over the past 15 \\nyears and the inability of several interested parties, including Dish Network and Comcast, to enter the market \\nusing their own networks provide evidence of efficient scale.',\n",

Each of the three major carriers has pledged substantial capital \\nreturns to shareholders: AT&T’s new dividend totals $8 billion annually and Verizon’s nearly $11 billion, while T-\\nMobile has said it can repurchase up to $60 billion of its shares through 2025. To support these returns, each of \\nthe carriers has guided investors to expect modest but steady revenue growth over the next several years. These \\nactions indicate that none of the carriers is looking to radically disrupt the current pricing structure in the industry \\nand that each will increase prices as needed to offset any cost pressures that emerge. \\nThe fixed-line enterprise services segment is AT&T’s next largest.

AT&T is one of only a handful of companies capable of providing \\ncomplex communications services to business customers with geographically diverse needs. We roughly estimate \\nthis segment earns 10%-15% returns on invested capital excluding goodwill (AT&T’s most recent major \\nacquisition in this area was the 2005 purchase of the legacy AT&T long-distance business). Business services \\nrevenue has steadily declined in recent years, falling to less than $23 billion in 2022 from $29 billion five years \\nearlier. Margins in this segment have held steady, but profits have also declined (EBITDA was less than $9 billion \\n2022 versus $11 billion in 2017). A significant but undisclosed amount of legacy business remains and will \\ncontinue to exert pressure on growth over the next several years, but AT&T has begun to focus its efforts on core \\nnetwork connectivity and services where its assets allow it to deliver unique solutions. Management expects the \\nsegment will near stability in 2023 with growth returning thereafter. \\nAT&T’s last significant business, consumer fixed-line services, doesn’t possess a moat, in our view.',\n",
       "  'We estimate \\nAT&T’s consumer fixed-line networks reach around 55 million homes, or a bit less than half of the U.S. \\npopulation. This business is challenged competitively across most of this footprint thanks to inferior networks \\nrelative to cable competitors. About 25% of the homes in this service territory subscribe to AT&T’s internet access \\nservice, around half the penetration level Comcast claims. The gap between AT&T and its cable rivals has steadily \\nwidened over the past several years. Customer penetration is critical to driving profitability in the telecom \\nbusiness and AT&T’s modest level has left returns on capital around 5%, by our estimate. \\nAT&T has upgraded about one third of its residential footprint to a fiber-to-the-premises network, which provides \\na much stronger competitive position versus cable. The firm plans to expand the FTTP network aggressively over \\nthe next few years, but it has a long way to go on this effort.

In other markets around the world, similarly sized competitors typically enjoy \\nbenign competitive environments. Gaining meaningful market share can take months or years of aggressive \\npricing, given how contracts are typically structured, allowing rivals to easily retaliate. Also, we don’t believe Dish \\nNetwork will disrupt the traditional wireless business. The firm has entered the prepaid market, acquiring the \\nSprint prepaid business. However, Dish holds extremely small market share. With a shaky financial position and a \\nnetwork likely better suited to narrow use cases, we don’t believe the firm will make a broad push into the \\ntraditional wireless market.\\nIn the consumer broadband segment, AT&T has steadily lost wallet share across most of the areas it serves, \\nmaking it increasingly difficult to justify the aggressive network spending needed to keep pace with cable rivals \\non a stand-alone basis. However, we think the segment will enjoy significant synergies with the wireless \\nbusiness as 5G technologies are deployed.',\n",

The transition from the legacy copper network to fiber holds the promise to markedly improve AT&T’s \\ncost structure and overall competitive position but not without significant uncertainty. AT&T plans to overlay \\nabout half its footprint with fiber by 2025. Keeping this effort on budget could be challenging given rising labor \\ncosts and potential zoning challenges. The firm also hopes to essentially abandon another 25% of its fixed-line \\nfootprint, offering only wireless in these areas. Getting these plans past regulators and lawmakers could prove \\ndifficult. \\nIn the fixed-line business services segment, AT&T’s position has strengthened in recent years thanks to \\nconsolidation, which has reduced the number of firms capable of delivering complex services to geographically \\ndiverse customers. The cable companies are expanding their capabilities in this market, but we expect these \\nfirms will need many years to replicate the local and global infrastructure needed to serve larger businesses well \\nwhile also earning healthy margins.

       "  \"The state of the balance sheet is \\nthe result of several ill-considered acquisitions, poorly timed share repurchases, and an insistence on increasing \\nthe dividend even as leverage mounted. Management is moving in the right direction, using the Warner spinoff \\nto shift to a dividend policy that better supports needed investment, but AT&T is still playing catch-up. It will need \\nto invest aggressively for the next several years to make its fixed-line network competitive, and it doesn’t expect \\nto get debt leverage below targeted levels until the end of 2023. With cash flow expectations coming down \\nrecently, we wouldn't be surprised if management pushes its targeted leverage date further out.  \\nThe firm’s run of heavy capital deployment began in 2012 with a massive share-repurchase program that, at the \\ntime, was billed as a temporary move away from AT&T’s 1.5 times net debt/EBITDA leverage target. The firm \\nrepurchased $27 billion of its shares through 2014 at prices per share in the mid-$30s, pushing leverage to 1.8 \\ntimes.\",\n",
       "  'The firm then pursued the AWS-3 auction, the DirecTV deal, expansion into Mexico, the Time Warner \\nacquisition, and the recent C-band auction. With leverage nearing 3.2 times EBITDA in early 2021, AT&T’s capital \\nstructure simply didn’t line up well with a large dividend payout. Yet management explicitly expressed support for \\nthe prior dividend until immediately before changing direction, catching long-suffering investors off guard.  \\nThese capital forays not only left AT&T with a weaker balance sheet, they also left the firm in a weaker \\ncompetitive position overall, in our view. With 2015’s DirecTV purchase, AT&T acquired a satellite TV business \\nthat was, at best, peaking in maturity. AT&T has sold a stake in the television business but still has exposure to \\nthis declining business. More importantly, as the firm was shifting its strategy, it didn’t invest as aggressively as \\nit should have in its core business. Until recently, it had prioritized short-term margins over maintaining wireless \\nmarket share, allowing T-Mobile to steadily steal customers.',\n",
       "  'In addition, AT&T has only begrudgingly invested to \\nexpand its fiber optic network in the past. New CEO John Stankey has increased investment to retain customers \\nand has made fiber construction a top priority, which should improve AT&T’s position but will also dent cash flow \\nover at least the next couple of years.  \\nAT&T has placed a priority on debt reduction since the Time Warner merger closed, using asset sales as a part of \\nthis effort. Not all these sales have made strategic sense, in our view. For example, the sale of its wireless assets \\nin Puerto Rico seemed odd, given the territory’s strong ties to the U.S. and AT&T’s presence elsewhere in Latin \\nAmerica. Management has also been less than forthright, in our view, concerning the debt load, using preferred \\nshares, receivables securitization, and vendor financing to cloud its financial picture.  \\nShareholders have suffered because of AT&T’s choices. The stock returned only 2% annually over the 20 years \\nleading up to the Warner spinoff and 3% over the previous decade, as a declining share price has partially offset \\ndividends paid.',\n",

       "  \"wireless industry, especially Verizon, has turned negative recently. We suspect \\nindustry bears hold two key contentions: First, the carriers will perpetually spend egregiously on their networks, \\nprimarily buying wireless spectrum whenever the government makes more available. Second, in an extremely \\nmature market, these firms will beat each other up seeking whatever growth remains, punishing revenue and \\nmargins. As such, balance sheets will continually need repair and cash available for shareholders will be \\nincreasingly limited.We believe this outlook is wrong. Following a series of spectrum auctions, AT&T and Verizon \\nhave acquired a trove of spectrum that should allow both firms to close the network speed and capacity gap that \\nT-Mobile has opened recently. Even with the huge increase in capital invested following these auctions, returns \\non capital remain acceptable for each of the wireless carriers, in our view. Going forward, we expect driving \\nreturns comfortably above the cost of capital will be the carriers' highest priority.Market share shifts gradually \\nthanks to phone installment plans and general customer inertia. As a result, we believe the carriers will have \\nincreasingly little to gain from huge new network initiatives or increased promotional intensity designed to grab \\nmarket share.\",\n",

This \\nprocess  ultimately  culminates  in our singlepoint  star rat-\\ning.\\n1.
