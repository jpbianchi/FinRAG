    "vs = [\"Lastly, during the quarter, we increased our reserves for general product and automobile self-\\ninsurance liabilities, driven by changes in our estimates about the cost of asserted and unasserted \\nclaims, resulting in additional expense of $1.3 billion. This impact is primarily recorded in cost of \\nsales on our income statement. As our business has grown quickly over the last several years, \\nparticularly as we've built out our fulfillment and transportation network, and claim amounts have \\nseen industry-wide inflation, we've continued to evaluate and adjust this reserve for both asserted \\nclaims, as well as our estimate for unasserted claims.\\nWe reported overall net income of $278 million in the fourth quarter. While we primarily focus our \\ncomments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pre-tax valuation loss \\nof $2.3 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian \\nAutomotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing \\noperations, but rather the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price. As we head into \\nthe New Year, we remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience.\",\"tenet of we want to find a way to meaningfully streamline our costs in all of our businesses, not \\njust their existing large businesses, but also in some of the investments we're making, we want to \\nactually do a pretty good thorough look about what we're investing and how much we think we \\nneed to. But doing so, without having to give up our ability to invest in the key long-term strategic \\ninvestments that we think could change broad customer experiences, and change Amazon over \\ntime.\\nAnd you saw that process led to us choosing to pause on incremental headcount, as we tried to \\nassess what was happening in the economy, and we eliminated some programs, Fabric.com, and \\nAmazon Care, and Amazon Glow, and Amazon Explore, and we decided to go slower on some -- \\non the physical store expansion and the grocery space until we had a format that we really \\nbelieved in rolling out, and we went a little bit slower on some devices. Until we made the very \\nhard decision that Brian talked about earlier, which was the hardest decision I think we've all been \\na part of, which was to reduce or eliminate 18,000 roles.\",\"operating income. This operating income was negatively impacted by three large items, which \\nadded approximately $2.7 billion of costs in the quarter. This is related to employee severance, \\nimpairments of property and equipment and operating leases, and changes in estimates related to \\nself-insurance liabilities. These costs primarily impacted our North America segment. If we had not \\nincurred these charges in Q4, our operating income would have been approximately $5.4 billion. \\nWe are encouraged with the progress we continue to make in streamlining the costs in our \\nAmazon Stores business. We entered the quarter with labor more appropriately matched to \\ndemand across our operations network, compared to Q4 of last year, allowing us to have the right \\nlabor, in the right place, at the right time, and drive productivity gains. We also saw continued \\nefficiencies across our transportation network, where process and tech improvements resulted in \\nhigher Amazon Logistics productivity and improved line haul fill rates. While transportation \\noverperformed expectations in the quarter, we also saw productivity improvements across our \\nfulfillment centers, in line with our plan. We also saw good leverage driven by strong holiday \\nvolumes.\"]"
