Management expects wireless customer additions will \\ndecline in 2023 as industry growth slows from the torrid pace of the past couple years, which will benefit cash \\nflow, but the firm also signaled that it will work to continue gaining share. We are maintaining our $25 fair value \\nestimate and think the stock remains modestly undervalued.\\nAT&amp;T added 656,000 postpaid phone customers during the fourth quarter, down from 884,000 a year ago and \\nplacing it between T-Mobile (927,000 net additions) and Verizon (217,000). The rate of customer defections \\n(churn) was flat versus the prior quarter, bucking the usual seasonal uptick as the impact of price increases taken \\nover the summer appears to have run its course. On the weak side, however, the firm’s share of new customer \\ndecisions (gross customer additions) dipped during the quarter. Of the big three carriers, only AT &amp;T attracted \\nfewer gross additions than in the prior quarter.\\nWireless service revenue increased 5.2% versus the prior year during the quarter. AT &amp;T’s postpaid phone \\ncustomer base has grown 3.5% over the past year and revenue per customer was 2.5% higher. The slowdown in \\ncustomer additions and a slower customer upgrade pace pulled equipment revenue lower but provided a lift to \\nprofitability. The wireless segment EBITDA margin increased nearly 3 percentage points versus a year ago to 38%.\\nFree cash flow hit $14.1 billion for the year, modestly topping management’s revised target, which it cut from $16 '</span>,\n",

The firm is the \\nthird-largest U.S. wireless carrier, connecting \\n69 million postpaid and 18 million prepaid \\nphone customers. Fixed-line enterprise \\nservices, which account for about 20% of \\nrevenue, include internet access, private \\nnetworking, security, voice, and wholesale \\nnetwork capacity. Residential fixed-line \\nservices, about 10% of revenue, primarily \\nconsist of broadband internet access service. \\nAT&amp;T also has a sizable presence in Mexico, \\nserving 21 million customers, but this \\nbusiness only accounts for 2% of revenue. \\nThe firm still holds a 70% equity stake in \\nsatellite television provider DirecTV but does \\nnot consolidate this business in its financial \\nstatements.billion over the summer. AT &amp;T expects to generate $16 billion of free cash flow in 2023 while it continues to \\ninvest aggressively in its network but with slower customer growth easing working capital needs.\\nConsumer fixed-line revenue increased 2.2% year over year with broadband sales up 6.4%. Broadband net \\ncustomer losses were modestly disappointing at 64,000, up from 20,000 a year ago despite continued expansion \\nof the fiber footprint. We expect AT &amp;T to add net broadband customers in 2023 as a growing portion of \\ncustomers are on the fiber network. Broadband pricing remains solid, as average revenue per fiber customer \\nincreased 9% versus a year ago to nearly $65 per month. EBITDA margins in this segment also continue to expand \\nnicely, hitting 37% during the quarter, up from 31% a year ago.\\nManagement dialed back fiber network expansion plans somewhat, claiming it will build to around 2.0 million-2.5 \\nmillion new customer locations annually through 2025, down from 3.5 million-4.0 million targeted previously and \\naround 3 million built in 2022. The firm still plans to reach 30 million customer locations, though this figure \\nincludes both homes and businesses. AT &amp;T is excited about its venture with BlackRock to build fiber networks \\noutside of the traditional AT &amp;T footprint and the prospects for winning government subsidies to build in rural \\nareas, stating that it will invest capital in whichever format proves the most profitable. We agree that the firm \\nshould explore all options on the table, but we aren’t clear yet why management is slowing the pace of the core \\nnetwork buildout.  K'</span>,\n",

Analysts  create  custom  industry  and \\ncompany  assumptions  to feed income  statement,  balance \\nsheet,  and capital  investment  assumptions  into our glob-\\nally standardized,  proprietary  discounted  cash  flow,  or \\nDCF,  modeling  templates.  We use scenario  analysis,  inde-\\npth competitive  advantage  analysis,  and a variety  of other \\nanalytical  tools  to augment  this process.  Moreover,  we \\nthink  analyzing  valuation  through  discounted  cash  flows \\npresents  a better  lens for viewing  cyclical  companies, \\nhigh-growth  firms,  businesses  with  finite  lives  (e.g., \\nmines),  or companies  expected  to generate  negative \\nearnings  over the next few years.  That said,  we don’t  dis-\\nmiss multiples  altogether  but rather  use them  as support-\\ning cross-checks  for our DCF-based  fair value  estimates. \\nWe also acknowledge  that DCF models  offer  their  own \\nchallenges  (including  a potential  proliferation  of estim-\\nated inputs  and the possibility  that the method  may miss \\nshortterm  market-price  movements),  but we believe  these \\nnegatives  are mitigated  by deep  analysis  and our \\nlongterm approach.\\nMorningstar’s  equity  research  group  (”we,”  “our”)  be-\\nlieves  that a company’s  intrinsic  worth  results  from  the \\nfuture cash flows it can generate. The Morningstar Rating \\nfor stocks  identifies  stocks  trading  at a discount  or premi-\\num to their  intrinsic  worth—or  fair value  estimate,  in \\nMorningstar  terminology.  Five-star  stocks  sell for the \\nbiggest  risk adjusted  discount  to their  fair values,  where-\\nas 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.\\nFour key components  drive  the Morningstar  rating:  (1) our \\nassessment  of the firm’s  economic  moat,  (2) our estimate \\nof the stock’s  fair value,  (3) our uncertainty  around  that \\nfair value  estimate  and (4) the current  market  price.  This \\nprocess  ultimately  culminates  in our singlepoint  star rat-\\ning.\\n1. Economic Moat\\nThe concept  of an economic  moat  plays  a vital role not \\nonly in our qualitative  assessment  of a firm’s  long-term \\ninvestment  potential,  but also in the actual  calculation  of \\nour fair value  estimates.  An economic  moat  is a structural \\nfeature  that allows  a firm to sustain  excess  profits  over a \\nlong  period  of time.  We define  economic  profits  as re-\\nturns  on invested  capital  (or ROIC)  over and above  our es-timate  of a firm’s  cost of capital,  or weighted  average \\ncost of capital  (or WACC).  Without  a moat,  profits  are \\nmore  susceptible  to competition.  We have  identified  five \\nsources  of economic  moats:  intangible  assets,  switching \\ncosts, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.\\nCompanies  with a narrow  moat  are those  we believe  are \\nmore  likely  than  not to achieve  normalized  excess  returns \\nfor at least  the next 10 years.  Wide-moat  companies  are \\nthose  in which  we have  very high confidence  that excess \\nreturns  will remain  for 10 years,  with excess  returns  more \\nlikely  than  not to remain  for at least  20 years.  The longer \\na firm generates  economic  profits,  the higher  its intrinsic \\nvalue.  We believe  low-quality,  no-moat  companies  will \\nsee their  normalized  returns  gravitate  toward  the firm’s \\ncost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.\\nWhen  considering  a company's  moat,  we also assess \\nwhether  there  is a substantial  threat  of value  destruction, \\nstemming  from  risks  related  to ESG,  industry  disruption, \\nfinancial  health,  or other  idiosyncratic  issues.  In this con-\\ntext, a risk is considered  potentially  value  destructive  if its \\noccurrence  would  eliminate  a firm’s  economic  profit  on a \\ncumulative  or midcycle  basis.  If we deem  the probability \\nof occurrence  sufficiently  high,  we would  not characterize \\nthe company as possessing an economic moat.\\nTo assess the sustainability of excess profits, analysts per-\\nform  ongoing  assessments  of the moat  trend.  A firm’s \\nmoat  trend  is positive  in cases  where  we think  its sources \\nof competitive  advantage  are growing  stronger;  stable \\nwhere  we don’t  anticipate  changes  to competitive  ad-\\nvantages  over the next several  years;  or negative  when \\nwe see signs of deterioration.\\n2. Estimated Fair Value\\nCombining  our analysts’  financial  forecasts  with  the \\nfirm’s  economic  moat  helps  us assess  how long returns \\non invested  capital  are likely  to exceed  the firm’s  cost of \\ncapital.  Returns  of firms  with a wide  economic  moat  rat-\\ning are assumed  to fade  to the perpetuity  period  over a \\nlonger  period  of time  than  the returns  of narrow-moat \\nfirms,  and both  will fade  slower  than  no-moat  firms,  in-\\ncreasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.\\nOur model is divided into three distinct stages:\\nStage I: Explicit ForecastIn this stage,  which  can last five to 10 years,  analysts \\nmake  full financial  statement  forecasts,  including  items \\nsuch  as revenue,  profit  margins,  tax rates,  changes  in \\nworkingcapital  accounts,  and capital  spending.  Based  on \\nthese  projections,  we calculate  earnings  before  interest, \\nafter  taxes  (EBI)  and the net new investment  (NNI)  to de-\\nrive our annual free cash flow forecast.\\nStage II: Fade\\nThe second  stage  of our model  is the period  it will take \\nthe company’s  return  on new invested  capital—the  re-\\nturn on capital  of the next dollar  invested  (“RONIC”)—to \\ndecline  (or rise) to its cost of capital.  During  the Stage  II \\nperiod,  we use a formula  to approximate  cash  flows  in \\nlieu of explicitly  modeling  the income  statement,  balance \\nsheet,  and cash  flow statement  as we do in Stage  I. The \\nlength  of the second  stage  depends  on the strength  of \\nthe company’s  economic  moat.  We forecast  this period  to \\nlast anywhere  from  one year (for companies  with no eco-\\nnomic  moat)  to 10–15  years  or more  (for wide-moat  com-\\npanies).  During  this period,  cash  flows  are forecast  using \\nfour assumptions:  an average  growth  rate for EBI over the \\nperiod,  a normalized  investment  rate,  average  return  on \\nnew invested  capital  (RONIC),  and the number  of years \\nuntil  perpetuity,  when  excess  returns  cease.  The invest-\\nment  rate and return  on new invested  capital  decline  un-\\ntil a perpetuity  value  is calculated.  In the case  of firms \\nthat do not earn their  cost of capital,  we assume  marginal \\nROICs  rise to the firm’s  cost of capital  (usually  attribut-\\nable  to less reinvestment),  and we may truncate  the \\nsecond stage.\\nStage III: Perpetuity\\nOnce  a company’s  marginal  ROIC  hits its cost of capital, \\nwe calculate  a continuing  value,  using  a standard  per-\\npetuity  formula.  At perpetuity,  we assume  that any \\ngrowth  or decline  or investment  in the business  neither \\ncreates  nor destroys  value  and that any new investment \\nprovides a return in line with estimated WACC.\\nBecause  a dollar  earned  today  is worth  more  than  a dollar \\nearned  tomorrow,  we discount  our projections  of cash \\nflows  in stages  I, II, and III to arrive  at a total  present \\nvalue  of expected  future  cash  flows.  Because  we are \\nmodeling  free cash  flow to the firm—representing  cash \\navailable  to provide  a return  to all capital  providers—we \\ndiscount  future  cash  flows  using  the WACC,  which  is a \\nweighted  average  of the costs  of equity,  debt,  and pre-\\nferred  stock  (and  any other  funding  sources),  using  ex-\\npected  future  proportionate  long-term,  market-value \\nweights.\\n3. Uncertainty Around That Fair Value Estimate\\nMorningstar’s  Uncertainty  Rating  is designed  to capture \\nthe range  of potential  outcomes  for a company’s  intrinsic \\nvalue.  This rating  is used  to assign  the margin  of safety \\nrequired  before  investing,  which  in turn explicitly  drives \\nour stock  star rating  system.

The rating  begins  with a suggested  rat-\\ning produced  by a quantitative  process  based  on the trail-\\ning 12-month  standard  deviation  of daily  stock  returns. \\nAn analyst  overlay  is then  applied,  with  analysts  using \\nthe suggested  rating,  historical  rating  data,  and their  own \\nknowledge  of the company  to inform  them  as they make \\nthe final Uncertainty  Rating  decision.  Ultimately,  the rat-\\ning decision  rests  with the analyst.  Analysts  take into ac-\\ncount  many  characteristics  when  making  their  final  de-\\ncision,  including  cyclical  factors,  operational  and financial \\nfactors  such  as leverage,  company-specific  events,  ESG \\nrisks,  and anything  else that might  increase  the potential \\ndispersion  of future  outcomes  and our ability  to estimate \\nthose outcomes. \\nOur recommended  margin  of safety—the  discount  to fair \\nvalue  demanded  before  we’d  recommend  buying  or \\nselling  the stock—widens  as our uncertainty  of the es-\\ntimated  value  of the equity  increases.

In addition,  the Uncertainty  Rat-\\ning provides  guidance  in portfolio  construction  based  on \\nrisk tolerance. \\nOur Uncertainty  Ratings  are: Low,  Medium,  High,  Very \\nHigh, and Extreme.\\nMargin of Safety\\nQualitative Analysis \\nUncertainty Ratings QQQQQ Rating QRating\\nLow 20% Discount 25% Premium\\nMedium 30% Discount 35% Premium\\nHigh 40% Discount 55% Premium\\nVery High 50% Discount 75% Premium\\nExtreme 75% Discount 300% Premium\\nOur uncertainty  rating  is based  on the interquartile  range, \\nor the middle  50% of potential  outcomes,  covering  the \\n25th percentile–75th  percentile.  This means  that when  a \\nstock  hits 5 stars,  we expect  there  is a 75% chance  that \\nthe intrinsic  value  of that stock  lies above  the current \\nmarket  price.  Similarly,  when  a stock  hits 1 star,  we ex-\\npect there  is a 75% chance  that the intrinsic  value  of that \\nstock lies below the current market price.\\n4.

Management expects wireless customer additions will \\ndecline in 2023 as industry growth slows from the torrid pace of the past couple years, which will benefit cash \\nflow, but the firm also signaled that it will work to continue gaining share. We are maintaining our $25 fair value \\nestimate and think the stock remains modestly undervalued.\\nAT&T added 656,000 postpaid phone customers during the fourth quarter, down from 884,000 a year ago and \\nplacing it between T-Mobile \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m927,000 net additions\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and Verizon \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m217,000\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.

AT &T’s postpaid phone \\ncustomer base has grown 3.5% over the past year and revenue per customer was 2.5% higher. The slowdown in \\ncustomer additions and a slower customer upgrade pace pulled equipment revenue lower but provided a lift to \\nprofitability.

The firm is the \\nthird-largest U.S. wireless carrier, connecting \\n69 million postpaid and 18 million prepaid \\nphone customers. Fixed-line enterprise \\nservices, which account for about 20% of \\nrevenue, include internet access, private \\nnetworking, security, voice, and wholesale \\nnetwork capacity. Residential fixed-line \\nservices, about 10% of revenue, primarily \\nconsist of broadband internet access service. \\nAT&T also has a sizable presence in Mexico, \\nserving 21 million customers, but this \\nbusiness only accounts for 2% of revenue. \\nThe firm still holds a 70% equity stake in \\nsatellite television provider DirecTV but does \\nnot consolidate this business in its financial \\nstatements.billion over the summer. AT &T expects to generate $16 billion of free cash flow in 2023 while it continues to \\ninvest aggressively in its network but with slower customer growth easing working capital needs.\\nConsumer fixed-line revenue increased 2.2% year over year with broadband sales up 6.4%. Broadband net \\ncustomer losses were modestly disappointing at 64,000, up from 20,000 a year ago despite continued expansion \\nof the fiber footprint. We expect AT &T to add net broadband customers in 2023 as a growing portion of \\ncustomers are on the fiber network. Broadband pricing remains solid, as average revenue per fiber customer \\nincreased 9% versus a year ago to nearly $65 per month. EBITDA margins in this segment also continue to expand \\nnicely, hitting 37% during the quarter, up from 31% a year ago.\\nManagement dialed back fiber network expansion plans somewhat, claiming it will build to around 2.0 million-2.5 \\nmillion new customer locations annually through 2025, down from 3.5 million-4.0 million targeted previously and \\naround 3 million built in 2022. The firm still plans to reach 30 million customer locations, though this figure \\nincludes both homes and businesses. AT &T is excited about its venture with BlackRock to build fiber networks \\noutside of the traditional AT &T footprint and the prospects for winning government subsidies to build in rural \\nareas, stating that it will invest capital in whichever format proves the most profitable. We agree that the firm \\nshould explore all options on the table, but we aren’t clear yet why management is slowing the pace of the core \\nnetwork buildout.  K'\u001b[0m,\n",

Analysts  create  custom  industry  and \\ncompany  assumptions  to feed income  statement,  balance \\nsheet,  and capital  investment  assumptions  into our glob-\\nally standardized,  proprietary  discounted  cash  flow,  or \\nDCF,  modeling  templates.  We use scenario  analysis,  inde-\\npth competitive  advantage  analysis,  and a variety  of other \\nanalytical  tools  to augment  this process.  Moreover,  we \\nthink  analyzing  valuation  through  discounted  cash  flows \\npresents  a better  lens for viewing  cyclical  companies, \\nhigh-growth  firms,  businesses  with  finite  lives  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32me.g., \\nmines\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m,  or companies  expected  to generate  negative \\nearnings  over the next few years.  That said,  we don’t  dis-\\nmiss multiples  altogether  but rather  use them  as support-\\ning cross-checks  for our DCF-based  fair value  estimates. \\nWe also acknowledge  that DCF models  offer  their  own \\nchallenges  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mincluding  a potential  proliferation  of estim-\\nated inputs  and the possibility  that the method  may miss \\nshortterm  market-price  movements\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m,  but we believe  these \\nnegatives  are mitigated  by deep  analysis  and our \\nlongterm approach.\\nMorningstar’s  equity  research  group  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m”we,”  “our”\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m  be-\\nlieves  that a company’s  intrinsic  worth  results  from  the \\nfuture cash flows it can generate. The Morningstar Rating \\nfor stocks  identifies  stocks  trading  at a discount  or premi-\\num to their  intrinsic  worth—or  fair value  estimate,  in \\nMorningstar  terminology.  Five-star  stocks  sell for the \\nbiggest  risk adjusted  discount  to their  fair values,  where-\\nas 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.\\nFour key components  drive  the Morningstar  rating:  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m1\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m our \\nassessment  of the firm’s  economic  moat,  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m2\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m our estimate \\nof the stock’s  fair value,  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m3\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m our uncertainty  around  that \\nfair value  estimate  and \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m4\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m the current  market  price.  This \\nprocess  ultimately  culminates  in our singlepoint  star rat-\\ning.\\n1. Economic Moat\\nThe concept  of an economic  moat  plays  a vital role not \\nonly in our qualitative  assessment  of a firm’s  long-term \\ninvestment  potential,  but also in the actual  calculation  of \\nour fair value  estimates.  An economic  moat  is a structural \\nfeature  that allows  a firm to sustain  excess  profits  over a \\nlong  period  of time.  We define  economic  profits  as re-\\nturns  on invested  capital  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mor ROIC\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m  over and above  our es-timate  of a firm’s  cost of capital,  or weighted  average \\ncost of capital  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mor WACC\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  Without  a moat,  profits  are \\nmore  susceptible  to competition.  We have  identified  five \\nsources  of economic  moats:  intangible  assets,  switching \\ncosts, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.\\nCompanies  with a narrow  moat  are those  we believe  are \\nmore  likely  than  not to achieve  normalized  excess  returns \\nfor at least  the next 10 years.  Wide-moat  companies  are \\nthose  in which  we have  very high confidence  that excess \\nreturns  will remain  for 10 years,  with excess  returns  more \\nlikely  than  not to remain  for at least  20 years.  The longer \\na firm generates  economic  profits,  the higher  its intrinsic \\nvalue.  We believe  low-quality,  no-moat  companies  will \\nsee their  normalized  returns  gravitate  toward  the firm’s \\ncost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.\\nWhen  considering  a company's  moat,  we also assess \\nwhether  there  is a substantial  threat  of value  destruction, \\nstemming  from  risks  related  to ESG,  industry  disruption, \\nfinancial  health,  or other  idiosyncratic  issues.  In this con-\\ntext, a risk is considered  potentially  value  destructive  if its \\noccurrence  would  eliminate  a firm’s  economic  profit  on a \\ncumulative  or midcycle  basis.  If we deem  the probability \\nof occurrence  sufficiently  high,  we would  not characterize \\nthe company as possessing an economic moat.\\nTo assess the sustainability of excess profits, analysts per-\\nform  ongoing  assessments  of the moat  trend.  A firm’s \\nmoat  trend  is positive  in cases  where  we think  its sources \\nof competitive  advantage  are growing  stronger;  stable \\nwhere  we don’t  anticipate  changes  to competitive  ad-\\nvantages  over the next several  years;  or negative  when \\nwe see signs of deterioration.\\n2. Estimated Fair Value\\nCombining  our analysts’  financial  forecasts  with  the \\nfirm’s  economic  moat  helps  us assess  how long returns \\non invested  capital  are likely  to exceed  the firm’s  cost of \\ncapital.  Returns  of firms  with a wide  economic  moat  rat-\\ning are assumed  to fade  to the perpetuity  period  over a \\nlonger  period  of time  than  the returns  of narrow-moat \\nfirms,  and both  will fade  slower  than  no-moat  firms,  in-\\ncreasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.\\nOur model is divided into three distinct stages:\\nStage I: Explicit ForecastIn this stage,  which  can last five to 10 years,  analysts \\nmake  full financial  statement  forecasts,  including  items \\nsuch  as revenue,  profit  margins,  tax rates,  changes  in \\nworkingcapital  accounts,  and capital  spending.  Based  on \\nthese  projections,  we calculate  earnings  before  interest, \\nafter  taxes  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mEBI\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m  and the net new investment  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mNNI\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m  to de-\\nrive our annual free cash flow forecast.\\nStage II: Fade\\nThe second  stage  of our model  is the period  it will take \\nthe company’s  return  on new invested  capital—the  re-\\nturn on capital  of the next dollar  invested  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m“RONIC”\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m—to \\ndecline  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mor rise\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m to its cost of capital.  During  the Stage  II \\nperiod,  we use a formula  to approximate  cash  flows  in \\nlieu of explicitly  modeling  the income  statement,  balance \\nsheet,  and cash  flow statement  as we do in Stage  I. The \\nlength  of the second  stage  depends  on the strength  of \\nthe company’s  economic  moat.  We forecast  this period  to \\nlast anywhere  from  one year \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mfor companies  with no eco-\\nnomic  moat\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m  to 10–15  years  or more  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mfor wide-moat  com-\\npanies\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  During  this period,  cash  flows  are forecast  using \\nfour assumptions:  an average  growth  rate for EBI over the \\nperiod,  a normalized  investment  rate,  average  return  on \\nnew invested  capital  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mRONIC\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m,  and the number  of years \\nuntil  perpetuity,  when  excess  returns  cease.  The invest-\\nment  rate and return  on new invested  capital  decline  un-\\ntil a perpetuity  value  is calculated.  In the case  of firms \\nthat do not earn their  cost of capital,  we assume  marginal \\nROICs  rise to the firm’s  cost of capital  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32musually  attribut-\\nable  to less reinvestment\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m,  and we may truncate  the \\nsecond stage.\\nStage III: Perpetuity\\nOnce  a company’s  marginal  ROIC  hits its cost of capital, \\nwe calculate  a continuing  value,  using  a standard  per-\\npetuity  formula.  At perpetuity,  we assume  that any \\ngrowth  or decline  or investment  in the business  neither \\ncreates  nor destroys  value  and that any new investment \\nprovides a return in line with estimated WACC.\\nBecause  a dollar  earned  today  is worth  more  than  a dollar \\nearned  tomorrow,  we discount  our projections  of cash \\nflows  in stages  I, II, and III to arrive  at a total  present \\nvalue  of expected  future  cash  flows.  Because  we are \\nmodeling  free cash  flow to the firm—representing  cash \\navailable  to provide  a return  to all capital  providers—we \\ndiscount  future  cash  flows  using  the WACC,  which  is a \\nweighted  average  of the costs  of equity,  debt,  and pre-\\nferred  stock  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mand  any other  funding  sources\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m,  using  ex-\\npected  future  proportionate  long-term,  market-value \\nweights.\\n3. Uncertainty Around That Fair Value Estimate\\nMorningstar’s  Uncertainty  Rating  is designed  to capture \\nthe range  of potential  outcomes  for a company’s  intrinsic \\nvalue.  This rating  is used  to assign  the margin  of safety \\nrequired  before  investing,  which  in turn explicitly  drives \\nour stock  star rating  system.

The rating  begins  with a suggested  rat-\\ning produced  by a quantitative  process  based  on the trail-\\ning 12-month  standard  deviation  of daily  stock  returns. \\nAn analyst  overlay  is then  applied,  with  analysts  using \\nthe suggested  rating,  historical  rating  data,  and their  own \\nknowledge  of the company  to inform  them  as they make \\nthe final Uncertainty  Rating  decision.  Ultimately,  the rat-\\ning decision  rests  with the analyst.  Analysts  take into ac-\\ncount  many  characteristics  when  making  their  final  de-\\ncision,  including  cyclical  factors,  operational  and financial \\nfactors  such  as leverage,  company-specific  events,  ESG \\nrisks,  and anything  else that might  increase  the potential \\ndispersion  of future  outcomes  and our ability  to estimate \\nthose outcomes. \\nOur recommended  margin  of safety—the  discount  to fair \\nvalue  demanded  before  we’d  recommend  buying  or \\nselling  the stock—widens  as our uncertainty  of the es-\\ntimated  value  of the equity  increases.  The more  uncertain \\nwe are about  the potential  dispersion  of outcomes,  the \\ngreater  the discount  we require  relative  to our estimate  of \\nthe value  of the firm before  we would  recommend  the \\npurchase  of the shares.  In addition,  the Uncertainty  Rat-\\ning provides  guidance  in portfolio  construction  based  on \\nrisk tolerance. \\nOur Uncertainty  Ratings  are: Low,  Medium,  High,  Very \\nHigh, and Extreme.\\nMargin of Safety\\nQualitative Analysis \\nUncertainty Ratings QQQQQ Rating QRating\\nLow 20% Discount 25% Premium\\nMedium 30% Discount 35% Premium\\nHigh 40% Discount 55% Premium\\nVery High 50% Discount 75% Premium\\nExtreme 75% Discount 300% Premium\\nOur uncertainty  rating  is based  on the interquartile  range, \\nor the middle  50% of potential  outcomes,  covering  the \\n25th percentile–75th  percentile.  This means  that when  a \\nstock  hits 5 stars,  we expect  there  is a 75% chance  that \\nthe intrinsic  value  of that stock  lies above  the current \\nmarket  price.  Similarly,  when  a stock  hits 1 star,  we ex-\\npect there  is a 75% chance  that the intrinsic  value  of that \\nstock lies below the current market price.\\n4. Market Price\\nThe market  prices  used  in this analysis  and noted  in the \\nreport  come  from  exchange  on which  the stock  is listed \\nwhich we believe is a reliable source.For more details about our methodology, please go to \\nhttps://shareholders.morningstar.com\\nMorningstar Star Rating for Stocks\\nOnce  we determine  the fair value  estimate  of a stock,  we \\ncompare  it with  the stock’s  current  market  price  on a \\ndaily  basis,  and the star rating  is automatically  re-calcu-\\nlated  at the market  close  on every  day the market  on \\nwhich  the stock  is listed  is open.  Our analysts  keep  close \\ntabs on the companies  they follow,  and, based  on thor-\\nough  and ongoing  analysis,  raise  or lower  their  fair value \\nestimates as warranted.\\nPlease  note,  there  is no predefined  distribution  of stars. \\nThat  is, the percentage  of stocks  that earn  5 stars  can \\nfluctuate  daily,  so the star ratings,  in the aggregate,  can \\nserve as a gauge of the broader market’s valuation. When \\nthere  are many  5-star  stocks,  the stock  market  as a whole \\nis more  undervalued,  in our opinion,  than  when  very few \\ncompanies garner our highest rating.\\nWe expect  that if our base-case  assumptions  are true the \\nmarket  price  will converge  on our fair value  estimate  over \\ntime  generally  within  three  years  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32malthough  it is im-\\npossible  to predict  the exact  time frame  in which  market \\nprices may adjust\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.\\nOur star ratings  are guideposts  to a broad  audience  and \\nindividuals  must  consider  their  own specific  investment \\ngoals,  risk tolerance,  tax situation,  time horizon,  income \\nneeds,  and complete  investment  portfolio,  among  other factors.\\nThe Morningstar  Star Ratings  for stocks  are defined  be-\\nlow:\\nQQQQQ  We believe  appreciation  beyond  a fair risk ad-\\njusted  return  is highly  likely  over a multiyear  time frame. \\nScenario  analysis  developed  by our analysts  indicates \\nthat the current  market  price  represents  an excessively \\npessimistic  outlook,  limiting  downside  risk and maximiz-\\ning upside potential.\\nQQQQ We believe  appreciation  beyond  a fair risk-ad-\\njusted return is likely.\\nQQQ Indicates  our belief  that investors  are likely  to re-\\nceive  a fair risk-adjusted  return  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mapproximately  cost of \\nequity\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.\\nQQ We believe  investors  are likely  to receive  a less than \\nfair risk-adjusted return.\\nQ Indicates  a high probability  of undesirable  risk-adjus-\\nted returns  from  the current  market  price  over a multiyear \\ntime  frame,  based  on our analysis.

New CEO John Stankey has increased investment to retain customers \\nand has made fiber construction a top priority, which should improve AT&T’s position but will also dent cash flow \\nover at least the next couple of years.  \\nAT&T has placed a priority on debt reduction since the Time Warner merger closed, using asset sales as a part of \\nthis effort. Not all these sales have made strategic sense, in our view. For example, the sale of its wireless assets \\nin Puerto Rico seemed odd, given the territory’s strong ties to the U.S. and AT&T’s presence elsewhere in Latin \\nAmerica. Management has also been less than forthright, in our view, concerning the debt load, using preferred \\nshares, receivables securitization, and vendor financing to cloud its financial picture.  \\nShareholders have suffered because of AT&T’s choices. The stock returned only 2% annually over the 20 years \\nleading up to the Warner spinoff and 3% over the previous decade, as a declining share price has partially offset \\ndividends paid.\",\"The firm then pursued the AWS-3 auction, the DirecTV deal, expansion into Mexico, the Time Warner \\nacquisition, and the recent C-band auction. With leverage nearing 3.2 times EBITDA in early 2021, AT&T’s capital \\nstructure simply didn’t line up well with a large dividend payout. Yet management explicitly expressed support for \\nthe prior dividend until immediately before changing direction, catching long-suffering investors off guard.  \\nThese capital forays not only left AT&T with a weaker balance sheet, they also left the firm in a weaker \\ncompetitive position overall, in our view. With 2015’s DirecTV purchase, AT&T acquired a satellite TV business \\nthat was, at best, peaking in maturity. AT&T has sold a stake in the television business but still has exposure to \\nthis declining business. More importantly, as the firm was shifting its strategy, it didn’t invest as aggressively as \\nit should have in its core business. Until recently, it had prioritized short-term margins over maintaining wireless \\nmarket share, allowing T-Mobile to steadily steal customers.\",\"We believe this operation holds a solid \\ncompetitive position in a consolidating market. AT&T is one of only a handful of companies capable of providing \\ncomplex communications services to business customers with geographically diverse needs. We roughly estimate \\nthis segment earns 10%-15% returns on invested capital excluding goodwill (AT&T’s most recent major \\nacquisition in this area was the 2005 purchase of the legacy AT&T long-distance business). Business services \\nrevenue has steadily declined in recent years, falling to less than $23 billion in 2022 from $29 billion five years \\nearlier. Margins in this segment have held steady, but profits have also declined (EBITDA was less than $9 billion \\n2022 versus $11 billion in 2017). A significant but undisclosed amount of legacy business remains and will \\ncontinue to exert pressure on growth over the next several years, but AT&T has begun to focus its efforts on core \\nnetwork connectivity and services where its assets allow it to deliver unique solutions. Management expects the \\nsegment will near stability in 2023 with growth returning thereafter. \\nAT&T’s last significant business, consumer fixed-line services, doesn’t possess a moat, in our view.\"]}"
